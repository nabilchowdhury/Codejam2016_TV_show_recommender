Pretty much in the same vein as Batman the animate series and Batman: Beyond. This show is so great and (dare I say) adult that it really puts the ultra campy, monkey written Super Friends to shame. The only complaints are the time and cliff hangers, Friday at 6 was a bad time for me personally so as a result I usually caught the tail end of the two parter or missed the resolution whenever I watched it. Since every episode is broken in to 2 parts it might be a good idea for cartoon network to expand the show to an hour. Other than that, top notch animation, amazing stories, great voice acting. Hey, what more could you want from a cartoon?",

If you judge the show on what it is trying to do- provide 40 minutes of heart-warming entertainment, then I think Rachel Bilson's nice-chick schtick and Lemon's bullying friendship along with great support from the rest of the cast, provides a nice alternative to practically every other TV programme out there.I love that Hart of Dixie lets you take it with a pinch of salt. I like watching a medically oriented programme that doesn't recycle those ER clich\u00e9s that every such show from Third Watch to Grey's Anatomy has to hobble through for the plot. 'Get the paddles! clear!', 'he's gone into v-tach', tacky-cardia. I mean gimme a break. I'm sorry but the fake blood, fake body parts, fake killing and murdering all have their place but if a show wants a lighter take on living, outside of Vegas, Miami and LA with fewer guns, more food, flirting, and dating and then what's not to like? I wish them many happy returns. Hart of Dixie definitely deserves a second and third season as far as I'm concerned. I think the show has plenty of material to explore with relationships, farce & fancy and the fish out of water element. I really hope it gets renewed.",

Often times, good fun should  take over for raunchiness and this is what  made this show so spectacular.

I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.It is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.Yes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.The scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.After watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like \"Merlin\" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.Even if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this.",

It is only sixteen episodes long but there isn't a moment wasted as it is jam packed with story and a large cast of memorable characters. When the cast it is first introduced in the opening credits it seems that it will be impossible to remember who is who but as they are such great characters it isn't so difficult. The great names also help; who could forget characters with names like Jacuzzi Splot, Czeslaw Meyer and Szilard Quates. The characters are a mix of immortals, gangsters and psychopaths living in 1930's America. Over the course of the series we learn how they became immortal, how they get to know each other and most importantly what happened aboard the 'Flying Pussyfoot' a transcontinental express bound for New York on board which most of the cast meet and many people die in unpleasant circumstances. Much of the series take place on the train but we also see frequent flash forwards of what happened before and what happens later, amazingly this does not lead to confusion.The series was a lot of fun but also included violent scenes which would make it unsuitable for younger viewers; the actions of 'Rail Tracer' might give them nightmares, they made me cringe and its a long time since I was a child. The animation looks fantastic, the slight sepia tint giving it a period look and distinctive characters made it a joy to watch, it also had a great musical score to accompany it.These comments are made based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles although I did see one of the episodes in English and thought the dub was pretty good.",

Even twenty-five years later, Jim Henson's genius and humanity shine through. Presented from the stage, backstage and even dressing rooms of the Muppet Theatre, the Muppet Show featured a regular company of performers who would try to present a variety show with the odds stacked firmly against them. At the centre of it all was Kermit the Frog, whose natural charm and calm in the face of madness were regularly tested to breaking point. Kermit's supporting cast included Miss Piggy (in my opinion, the weakest character), The Great Gonzo (a reckless daredevil who'll do anything dangerous or painful in the name of entertainment), Fozzie Bear (a hopeless stand-up comedian with sad eyes but a smiling face), Dr Teeth and the Electric Mayhem (a hippie-style pit band whose most notable member was the insane drummer, Animal) and various other pigs, chickens, lobsters, frogs, freaks, misfits and lunatics. Every week a guest star would show up to be sabotaged, and the show's innocently anarchic style of humour meant that even when the scripts were lacking, the charm was not and there was always much to admire in the puppets themselves.CLASSIC MUPPET MOMENTS...Leo Sayer singing 'When I Need You' with a bunch of woodland animals; Floyd Pepper's \"I have a room for life at the home for the chronically groovy\" speech; Animal's version of 'Wild Thing'; Kermit's classic and heart-rending 'It's Not Easy Being Green'; Crazy Harry helping Gonzo with his cannonball stunt; the ballroom dancing segments (under his hat, Zoot was bald!); John Cleese as Long John Silver with a moaning parrot; Dr Bunsen Honeydew's increasingly bizarre mistreatment of Beaker; the continuing hospital saga with Rowlf the pianist dog turning his paw to acting (and however many times you see it, the cast looking to see where the announcer's voice is coming from will always be funny); Animal drumming with Rita Moreno; Waldorf and Statler's heckling; Alice Cooper upsetting Sam the bald eagle; Sweetums; Lew Zealand's musical fish; the Muppaphone; James Coburn leading an oriental hoedown; Julie Andrews singing \"high on a hill stood a lonely goatherd\" with a goat; Angus McGonnagal the gargling Argyll gargoyle...and not forgetting 'Mahna Mahna'.A classic from the top drawer of Muppetational mayhem.",

Luckily I like cartoons anyway but nothing could have prepared me for the head-over-heels way I have fallen in love with CHOWDER! Since this is a new show there isn't much I can tell you: The characters are all really weird looking (What IS Chowder anyway? A cat??? A bunny?????) and one character Schnitzel only speaks using one word: \"Radda\" (I don't know why this joke never worked for me with CoCo on FOSTER'S HOME FOR IMAGINARY FRIENDS but every time Schintzel says \"Radda Radda Radda!\" I just fall out of my chair laughing.(For me Schnitzel is the break-through \"star\" of the show) Most of the story lines so far revolve around food, as Chowder is sort of an apprentice chef. And the jokes are all over the map from goofy to fart jokes to stuff I think is aimed more at the grown up audience. It feels like someone put some stuff from those old BULLWINKLE cartoons, a splash of SPONGEBOB and a tiny bit of FUTURAMA into a blender. This show has that certain type of humor that works for both kids AND grownups.The other day my daughter was at a friend's house and I was watching CHOWDER and my husband came in and asked me why I was watching cartoons. I made him watch it and I felt totally embarrassed as I proceeded to laugh so hard that I actually cried! He didn't feel as strongly as I did about it, but he DID agree it was a \"pretty good show\".I'm glad to come on here and see that I am not the only person older than 12 who enjoys this hilarious, bright,witty new show!On A Scale Of 1 - 10 I give CHOWDER 9 Raddas!",

One likes to take these new shows and give them a place to live and grow, to go beyond the normal, dare I say crap, we see on TV.  And the other entity is the one who gets to control the show once it's signed on.  It's the thing that says \"You're on here, opposite Monday Night Football...no wait, at 3AM on Tuesdays...no wait, Fridays at 9!\"  This entity is of substandard intelligence and may very well be Rupert Murdoch.

    "top_review": "While Masters of Horror Season 1 came and went with it's share of criticisms, I personally thought it was a clear hit. Sure not every episode was flat out scary or true horror, but then again most movies that come out aren't either. And there in lies why the series works. Some of the top writers of the horror genre combined with the top directors in the genre to provide a series were each episode had a unique flare. Sure some episodes were better than others, but that just how it goes.Here's my quick thoughts on the series with the episodes ranked as to how I liked them. If looking for a synopsis of each show, look elsewhere.1. Jennifer - This was Dario Argento at the top of his game and the best thing he's done in years. Steven Weber did an excellent job in the lead role and as the writer of the teleplay. The episode generally creeped me out and it had truly disgusting scenes. The best show of the first season.2. Cigarette Burns - Most John Carpenter movies provide the view with a slow build of suspense which leads to a final outcome. This episode is no exception. Again one of the better things Carpenter has done in awhile and I love the story concept. The one flaw was the the search for this extremely rare film seemed a bit rushed. Cant help but think this would have made an even better full length film.3. Deer Woman - A classic example of horror comedy, done only as John Landis can do it. The lead character was great. Almost everything about the episode just clicked.4. Incident On and Off a Mountain Road - A clever story based off a Joe Lansdale tale, directed by Don Coscarelli. It's great to see a strong female lead and one that may be more twisted than the serial killer she takes on.5. The Fair Haired Child - A Lovecraftian type story that really surprised me. The creature in this one was incredible. Directed by William Butler and was far better than the few movies his done.6. The Pick Me Up - The man who bought us ultra campy horror movies in the 70's & 80's, Larry Cohen puts together a solid episode pitting a girl against two deranged serial killers.7. Haeckel's Tale - Taken from a story from Clive Barker (which is again very Lovecraftian) and directed by John McNaughton. Definitely some very disturbing scenes but a fairly interesting episode none the less.8. Dance of the Dead - Tobe Hooper directed this episode, and it really a far cry from what he normally does. Very MTV video style. Nice twist.9. Dreams in the Witch House - Stuart Gordon does HP Lovecraft as only he can. A twisted little story that updates the story for modern times.10. Sick Girl - An odd tale by Lucky McKee that loaded with dark humor. A nice concept.11. The Homecoming - Many great horror movies actually have a lot of political subtext. This episode is a flat out slap at the current War in Iraq and the Presidential regime. This one makes you think a bit.12. Chocolate - I liked the story behind this Mick Garris episode and though it fell apart a little at the end. Overall it's not that bad.",

I can't imagine anyone else having their roles. Daniel Dae Kim is fine in his role...the only problem I have is with Grace Park.

And the adults (including Jessie) are just as self-indulged and irresponsible as the kids.I also think the episodes are getting weaker as the seasons progress.

The interest in LFN the series was global - many Web sites were created and dedicated to the show's characters and actors who portrayed them.

But with these two you get a laugh. It's a fine line, their humor and wit can be used for good as well as evil, but when they are together, it's so good. I'm jealous of the guy, i can say this stuff to my mates but i can't say it to a woman, at least without serious repercussions.This is a love story, done so well. I don't know the demographic they're aiming for. i think a lot of guys will get it, but it's women that should watch it. I would insert some of the things the guys said to his pregnant soon to be wife here, but without context, it may seem mean.Forget The Notebook, or 50 Shades of Grey, or whatever moronic love story is popular right now. This is the fictional love i want. Put your feelings out there, be supportive but not a doormat, make fun of each others insecurities in a way that recognizes their insignificance but recognizes their significance, and laugh with each other. 10 out of 10",

Thank you, Odin:-)As a person of some historical knowledge of the viking era, I can point out numerous flaws - but they don't ruin the story for me, so I will let them slip. Historical accounts about those days are, after all, not entirely reliable.Happy to see Travis Fimmel in a role that totally suits him. A physical and intense character, with that spice of humor that is the viking trademark from the sagas. Gabriel Byrne plays a stern leader, that made me think of him in \"Prince of Jutland\", and Clive Standen seems like he's going to surprise us.Been pondering the Game of Thrones comparison, since I love that show too, but in my opinion Vikings has its own thing going on. Way fewer lead characters to begin with, and also a more straight forward approach. Plenty of room for more series with this high class!Can I wish for more than the planned nine episodes, PLEASE!!!",

I'm not going to post any spoilers but I can say the story significantly improves in my opinion and so does the care factor for the characters and where its all going by the end. The finale is a blast and had my girlfriend look at me with her mouth wide open after the ending and that we need to wait until next summer for the follow up... She wants to see it right now! As do I. The season ended very well and the show has been massively underrated on here. If you haven't seen the show or you've seen a few episodes and aren't sure.

Yes, it's set in the future, not in a whitewashed Starfleet Federation world, but rather in a civilization where technological development has outpaced ethical considerations. In fact, it shares many similarities to \"Fringe\", which isn't surprising considering the number of ex-fringe producers, especially J.H. Wyman. After the first two episodes, it's clear that the title \"Almost Human\" is more a theme than a name. Karl Urban's character has a synthetic leg, and his partner is an android, a model that was discontinued because of a tendency to have human-like emotional outbursts. Neither completely man nor machine, both characters feel like outsiders to the status quo.I'm not sure what direction the show is going for the long term, but here's hoping it gets a decent run of a few seasons.

    "top_review": "It is very rare that you have a near perfect episode, especially of a series on commercial television. But FX has done it here with The Americans. It is nearly flawless. Great mind candy for the thinking person, with something to come back to after the first viewing. I credit the success of The Americans to 3 things: Great script, great music, and Matthew Rhys.The script is adult, no-nonsense storytelling built on an original premise, the Cold War. Those of us who are old enough remember this period, a period of the Russians-are-coming hysteria that was second only to the Civil Rights movement the decade before. An era very under- represented in film and ignored on the small screen, comes to life for a new generation.Of course this era would be nothing without the music of this time and again, The Americans is flawless. \"Harden my Heart\" opens the series, and how appropriate. Disguised, and ready to perform sexual acts for information, we first meet the series heroine, Elizabeth Jennings whose heart is truly hardened. Fast forward to a back alley chase and we are introduced to our hero(?) Phillip to the pulsations of \"Tusk\" by Fleetwood Mac. \"Tusk\" is appropriate here too. Just think about it.Must mention these disguises too, which are not your silly, unrealistic mission-impossible disguises. No, the disguises in The Americans are really disguises and surprisingly, with very little disguise. What makes these disguises work for the Jennings is that the Jennings can act. With each disguise is a new personality. Elizabeth does her disguise well but the master of disguise is Phillip.Phillip, played by Matthew Rhys, is special, or should I say, Matthew Rhys is special as Phillip. Rhys takes the art of disguise to the next stage. He is authentic, nerdy and funny in disguise talking to Martha, reminding you of a young John Ritter. And then as the kick-your-ass, baddest-ass-kicking daddy of them all over a barbecue pit, Rhys is wonderfully dangerous, stellar, and I can't get enough of him.This series only has to live up to its pilot a little bit. The series has everything: originality, sex, espionage, suspense...did I say originality? And yes, Matthew Rhys who has the role of his life, I daresay, the role he has been waiting for, is the welcomed surprise here. Hat's off to casting. Can't wait to see what they are going to do with this.",

    "top_review": "SUITS is smart, sassy, clever, sophisticated, timely and immensely entertaining! The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately. SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact. The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclich\u00e9d, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit!

Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law.

No SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION here, folks, no benevolent GREEN MILE guards or saintly supernatural inmates. OZ tells it like it is, and baby, it ain't pretty.Using at times a sense of hyper-realism, (in the narrations of the excellent Harold Perrineau, who serves as the show's conscience and Greek chorus), OZ shows us both the profane and profound aspects of prison life that we good, law-abiding citizens don't like to think about. We have the \"authorities\" to take care of that, don't we?Exceptional art, no matter what the medium, has the ability to move us, make us think, make us feel both things we embrace and things we reject. The power this show has to polarize viewers into two different camps--love it or hate it--is proof enough that Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, the forces behind HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS, have fashioned something we haven't seen the likes of in a very long time.I would strongly suggest that anyone who has not yet seen it give it a try, if you have HBO. Then I dare you to tear yourself away from it. It's rare television that makes you sit up, take notice, and actually care about even the minor characters in an ensemble such as this, no matter how heinous their crimes, or how street-and-battle-hardened their exteriors.Augustus Hill, Simon Adebisi, Tobias Beecher, Vern Schillinger, Chris Keller, Jefferson Keane, Ryan O'Reilly, Kareem Said, Nino Schibetta, Bob Rebadow, Tim McManus, Warden Leo Glynn, Sister Peter-Marie, Father Ray, Officer Diane Wittlesey and all the others will imprint themselves on your memory and stay there, until you can't wait to find out what happens next.A blend of black humor and outright horror, cutting commentary and the basest brutality, it is one of the very few shows being done now that can reveal the most majestic qualities of the human spirit. The ongoing struggle to resist surrendering to impulses and urges that cause the evil that men do, in the one place you would least expect to find any light--in a sea of human misery and darkness.",

There's nothing more satisfying than seeing snobbish starlets, overhyped matinee idols, and self-aggrandizing mega-entertainers maim each other and humiliate themselves in front of the entire world (as clay facsimiles, of course).But despite all the schadenfreude, it's all in good fun. Fictional hosts Johnny Gomez and Nick Diamond provide a hilarious running commentary on the grisly goings-on with nonstop puns, quips, and zingers at the unfortunate celebrities' expense. Real-life referee Mills Lane moderates the bouts and sometimes even plays a crucial role in which celebrity will win. And the celebrities themselves (actually impersonated by voiceover artists) have the most fun of all, coming up with ever more creative ways to annihilate each other while making references galore to their own movies, their opponents' movies, and pop culture in general.\"Celebrity Deathmatch\" is even more fun to watch if you have a bunch of friends over and you want to do some Vegas-style gambling. Wagering on the outcome of the fights can be fun, but be forewarned: don't always root for the more popular celebrity (for example, Eddie Murphy over Nick Nolte). The playing field is level in these fights, and just about anything goes - so the victor may surprise you. Bet on your personal favorite instead.",

It involves an unlikely trio who are bound together in an attempt to create a market-worthy personal computer. The year is 1983 and IBM rules the market.First, there is Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a type A rainmaker from New York whose opinion of himself may only be eclipsed by his ability to sell anything to anybody. He lands a job at Cardiff Electric in Texas and promises to overhaul their sales figures. But does he have deeper, perhaps darker, plans?Joe aligns himself with one of Cardiff's corporate drones, Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), an apathetic near-alcoholic who would seem to have nothing to offer. But Joe sees something in Gordon and challenges him to think beyond the meager circumstances of his conformist life. It's a dangerous gambit for Gordon, whose wife wants nothing more than conformity and reliability.Joe also crosses paths with a young woman named Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), a self-sufficient young woman who lives outside society's rules, though not very profitably. Though she is extremely experienced at working with computers and code, she spends her time playing video games in an arcade and scoffing at conformity and the rules of society. Physically, she reminds me of Mary Stuart Masterson in \"Some Kind of Wonderful\". Each of the three may possess a particular kind of genius. Or they may just be destined losers; it is difficult to tell.Joe's plan involves reverse engineering an IBM PC and then--well, it is difficult to tell just where his plan may lead them, but it will undoubtedly be a risky enterprise. Can he be the glue that holds this volatile team together? After watching the pilot for \"Halt and Catch Fire\", I am willing to watch and find out. It's a compelling premise and the actors are very watchable.After you fire a shot across the bow of IBM, how do you keep them from raiding your enterprise?Update: Now that I have watched a few episodes, I am happy to report that each of the various primary actors are being fleshed out and they have their own story lines and characteristics. Joe, as anticipated, is a force of nature.Further update 6/30/14: There is good writing and there is writing so good you wish you had written it. H&CF falls into the latter class.

Apart from The Killing, there aren't many TV shows which revolve around broken and unlikable characters. It just isn't pleasant to watch stressed, struggling and often unpredictable people. Yet, such TV leaves you feeling like you experienced something emotional. Among all the ugliness, even the smallest pleasant act or scene can mean a lot; when our tiny hopes for a positive resolution are fulfilled, we appreciate it all the more. The acting and cinematography are great. The interactions are realistic and the viewer understands each character. Every scene seems important and keeping focus is rewarding. Not knowing what to believe, whom to trust and what the motivations are, is a necessary part of such a show, however what subtle hints we do get are delivered very well. I don't want to praise this show prematurely, considering we have only seen one episode, however if it keeps up the twists, plots and great characters, I am sure it will be a success. Considering the amount of people who feel the irresistible need to tell others their views on religion, I suppose a lot of viewers will express strong opinions about the themes of this show. I hope others will not be dissuaded by those opinions. This is a clever show, definitely not aimed at advertising anyone's beliefs or conversely, offending anyone else's.",

If your problem is that this is not a frame-by-frame remake of the 1997 version, just Netflix it or buy the DVDs and watch it.

How believable was \"Lost\" or \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" or \"The Twilight Zone\" or any of hundreds of great shows?

It's character development and the plots of the whole DBZ story is superb, the animation is full of action, and every ending of an episode leaves you wondering what may happen next. It also contains a bit of humor as well as subplots. When I first seen it in 1996, I was overwhelmed at how much action and comedy was fit into one anime series. I found Goku and Vegeta to be serious but a bit funny in between, and the roles of Gohan and Piccolo weren't shabby either. It has a whole saga inside which makes it worth watching.Overall, I watched this cartoon more than all the other cartoons put together. I like it even better than Inuyasha, which is also good. My favorite episode is when Goku finally becomes a Super Saiyen, and Frieza later gets cut in half by a flying disk. You may have to watch this series from the beginning to get the full meaning of the story and what is going on, but if you see this on Cartoon Network or any other channel, watch it! Don't miss out! It is definitely worth seeing for the eye.",

    "top_review": "There has been a good bit of criticism regarding the production budget of this series. I don't have the numbers right at hand, but clearly the great majority--if not all--of the shooting is done on a sound stage. This saves money, of course, but I think there is more to it. The world of Olympus is set in ancient Greece; but it is a world in which the gods are real, and supernatural powers are part of ordinary existence. I think that the oddly-crafted set pieces are deliberately intended to evoke a world that is similar to our own, but not quite ours. Perhaps this world is a psychological state of mind; the series synopsis tells us that the gods will eventually be consigned to the world of the unconscious, what they call the Underworld, or Hades. When this happens, the entire world will change...is this not perception? Watching this series brings to mind the German Expressionist movement in film. They both share the use of stylized set pieces, and the plots and stories of both often deal with madness, hallucination, and betrayal. And let's not forget that film noir arose out of expressionism; the eerie, atmospheric lighting, somewhat hapless protagonist, and the irrepressible femme fatale elements of noir can be readily by seen in Olympus. If you examine this series through that lens I think you will gain a better appreciation of it.UPDATE: It is Aug 26 2015, and I wrote the above approximately a week before. I had not viewed the entire series by then, but I have now. If you have already made up your mind about this series, and decided that you hate it, nothing I say here will effect your opinion. But if you like the series, or are still undecided, I encourage you--nay, I entreat you--to watch it to the end. The final three episodes are spell-binding, and the season (perhaps series) conclusion is quite surprising and satisfying. This series has cemented its position on my short list of best series ever. It went by so fast I could hardly believe it was over. You owe it to yourself to give this show a chance.",

I was in a way wondering if I was just wasting my time and watching a series that would fall short of everyone's expectations and just flop, like so many other TV series do nowadays. However, that didn't happen at all.The performances were outstanding in my opinion. Martin Freeman was excellent and to my surprise did the accent fairly well. Billy Bob Thornton was amazing as Lorne Malvo, the enigmatic vibe you get from his performance gave me chills.The cinematography is also one of the good things about this pilot. The shots are smart and intriguing, yet still simple and not too overdone. The music is also outstanding. There are times when it is quirky and funny, there are times where it is tragic and sad yet epic, and then there are also the times when it is intense and mysterious.Fargo is mysterious, intense, funny (at times), tragic and just simply plain awesome! I really hope there are more to come like this.10/10",

The war itself is dismissed with rather too quickly but as that was the subject of Homer's other great work \"THE ILIAD\" this is excusable.Less easy to excuse is the omission of Odysseus's encounter with the sirens which is an integral part of the legend and which was quite well done in the 1954 Italian version of the tale starring Kirk Douglas.Other gods and monsters,however are excellently done especially the cave monster Scylla. A quality production which deserves to be seen by a world-wide audience,this giant amongst mini-series has never been shown on British t.v.( probably because there are no policemen or doctors in it)or released on video. With NTSC compatible video recorders now widely available in the U.K. I strongly advise obtaining the superb American video of \"THE ODYSSEY\" for anyone whose tastes run to mythic fantasy yarns like \"JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS\" to which this is very similar.Why do the likes of George Lucas try to create their own mythology when there is so much untapped material like this they could be making instead?....Go figure.",

An update or film version have been arguably long overdue.There's no talking Snarf in the latest version but the major difference with the Thundercats 2011 is the setting, there's no 3rd earth, it's Thundera, that is in a Planet of the Apes sort way with flashbacks throughout. There's glimpses of Star Wars, Stargate and other sci-fi, but it borrows from the best. The characters dynamics, look and their relationships have been slightly tweaked. The mains given a more mature edge that allows exploration of conflicting divergences. Those familiar with the original will recognise new incarnations of reworked sub characters usually the antagonists.Thundercats 2011 is reminiscent of He-man more so than its 1985 predecessor due to Thundera's Eternia-like feel and borrows from plenty from the recent Lord of the Rings trilogy especially in look during battle scenes including the civilians going underground. That aside, the animation, stories and dialogue are extremely entertaining and there are plenty of nods to the original series. It also includes a cameo from the original Lion-o voice actor Larry Kenney.However, don't be mistaken it is different and not in a bad way, strikingly the episodes are very emotionally charged even more so than the original series. There are a few main characters that are omitted in the first fistful of episodes but that's not to say then may not grace the screen in later outings.To really enjoy Thundercats 2011 most will have to put aside the cartoon they fell in love with. This is a darker distinctly styled incarnation yet thankfully it stays true to the original spirit of the Thundercats.",

Personally I am especially fond of the fact that all the characters are displayed as human, vulnerable, and yet utter bastards, constantly trying to get one over their fellow human being. Never before has stark realism been so entertaining.However, I must admit that the fact that different instances of this series have been successful in the UK, the US and Germany chills me to the bone. It is unsettling to think that, across different continents and cultures, large parts of mankind are busy nicking boxes of toner from the office supplies cabinet, ogling their female desk-mates and mobbing their hapless, pudgy colleagues just to make themselves look better by comparison. It simply doesn't bode well for mankind.",

And the addition of a fine looking black detective with the unlikely name of Dershowitz for Mary to butt heads and crack wise with is pure gold.I do agree that the mother and sister are best in small doses, but they do provide a nice slightly off-balance counterpoint to the thoroughly professional handle Mary has on her work life. One line describes the relationship beautifully: in replying to her n'er-do-well sister's question about why Mary won't just get rid of her defective car, she says \"because, like my family, I love it a little more than I want to kill it.\" The people she's protecting have been getting better and better with each successive show. The most recent, David Foley, was a real hoot as an assassin's middleman.All in all, I don't care if it's not exactly as law enforcement would do it.

There are also many tragic moments that would pass you by if you didn't know what came before. Many lines have double or even triple meanings. Watch this from the beginning, with a friend. Believe me, you will want to discuss each episode afterward to figure out some of the nuances of what happened.The main Mad Man is the confident womanizer Don Draper, who is head of the Creative department at a mid-sized ad agency in 1960s Madison Avenue. I admit, at first I kind of hated him, but as the viewer learns more about him and his past, I learned to - not love him exactly - but like him and want to watch him endlessly. He is a complicated character who can be a very good man, but also a very bad man.Don Draper is joined by a rich cast of supporting characters, many of whom deserve a show of their own: The ambitious young Campbell who is utterly sleazy most of the time, but has occasional moments of growth and even cuteness.Peggy Olson starts out as Draper's secretary, but her growth into a strong, confident woman mirrors what is happening for Woman in the 60's. Silver fox Stirling - he may be morally bankrupt but gets some of the best lines. I could go on . . .The 60's clothes, hairstyles, decor, and current events provide an interesting backdrop for what is essentially a character piece. The setting provides both the occasional laugh (cigarettes being advertised as \"healthy\") and the more than occasional cringe (how could dumping trash from a picnic in the park right on the grass ever seem okay?!).If you need fast-paced action or a laugh track, this definitely isn't the show for you. But, if you like character development and subtlety in your television shows, rent the first seasons on DVD and settle in. You won't regret it.",

The stories focus on those at one of the avenue's smaller firms, Sterling Cooper, and its various incarnations over the decade. At the heart of these stories is Donald Draper, the creative genius of the company. That professional creative brilliance belies the fact of a troubled childhood, one that he would rather forget and not let anyone know about except for a select few, but one that shaped who he is as an adult and as an ad man in the need not only to sell products but sell himself to the outside world. His outward confidence also masks many insecurities as evidenced through his many vices, such as excessive smoking, drinking and womanizing - the latter despite being a family man - and how he deals with the aftermath of some of the negative aspects of his life.",

This is one of the BEST new animated series in a long time, and has quickly become my favorite animated show.Unlike most animated shows that seem to exist in some kind of vacuum (each episode has nothing to do with the other), DANNY PHANTOM has a continuing storyline. The story gets better and better with each episode, and yet at the same time, each episode is great standing alone. Kudos to the writers for that.The characters themselves are funny, interesting and quickly draw you in to their lives. Kudos to the actors for this. I love the Danny and Sam storyline, and at the same time the ghost villains are some of the best villains in animation today.The animation style is wonderful as well.

The trials and tribulations of Carrie Bradshaw and her three friends is as riveting as it is true. As a straight male viewer of this show, I think that it gave me a lot of insight into the female aspect of a relationship and the world as a whole. This show also changed the way the public views women. Carrie and company are strong, self-sufficient women who even dislike serious relationships and the prospect of marriage. This is far from the housewife days of \"Leave it to Beaver\" and \"Father Knows Best\". Particularly stunning about this show is the acting. Although much has been said about the relationships between the stars of the show, the characters they portray have such a sense of reality and conviction that they seem like ordinary people trying to get by. Why this show was not awarded more is beyond me.

Cutting a few too many corners is what forced her to leave. Raydor will never cut corners, she's all about the rules.Like Sedgwick this first season and probably for some time after that McDonnell will be gradually winning over, Tao, Flynn, Sanchez and Provenza,those who hold over from Brenda Lee's crew. Brenda Lee's crew took a long time to warm up to her and even though McDonnell rose from the ranks, the squad views her still as the woman who was investigating their methods from The Closer.I'm not sure that bringing in Graham Patrick Martin a street kid who was a material witness to a murder left over from the last episode of The Closer is a good fit. Clearly he's brought in for two reasons, to get a younger audience watching the show and to develop a personal life for Captain Raydor.

One critic went so far as to say he would never give this show another chance after viewing the pilot. What tripe and how close minded. I gave Hannibal a chance, a re-working of another well-known character, and was richly rewarded. I intend to give this series a shot, let it unfold and see how it hits me, as a big fan of the 1976 Richard Donner film from which it draws thematically and musically. What I like about the pilot episode: the modern updating, the acting, the music, and not making Damien good or bad but basically innocent until his 30th birthday (why, I will leave for you to discover), upon which he must start grappling with horrific memories of his long-past childhood. It makes no sense for Damien to start out evil in this show, as that leaves his character nowhere to go. What I hope will be explored is if the nature of evil, whether you believe in Revelation/the Bible or not, is a growth, a given, a concept that can be overcome, or something you ultimately must submit to and revel in as your true nature. And that conflict, the gray area, is much more interesting to me. This series will sink or swim, based on its ability to draw out that narrative. And in just viewing the pilot, I think it has a lot of possibility.",

    "top_review": "When I was twenty-four, I was the foreman for the jury of a murder trial. There was plenty of evidence, including eye witness testimony, that indicated the young man's guilt. After two days of deliberations and endless discussions, we voted to convict. On our way out of the courtroom, I remember distinctly the high spirits we were all in. We had done our job as citizens. We had helped take a bad man off the streets. We helped get justice for a murdered individual. There were a lot of smiles and handshakes and back-pats. Then on the way out we passed the convicted man's eight-month-along pregnant wife. She was sitting, alone, on a bench outside the courtroom, sobbing. The implications of our decision for her and that unborn child hit me all at once as we passed. I wasn't smiling anymore; none of us were. The thing is, I still believe we did the right thing. It was our job to vote on the evidence and that's what we did. But even so, I'd be lying if I said I slept soundly that night.The reason I mention that long-winded story is to illustrate a point. Real life is messy. Even when we make what we truly believe are the \"right\" decisions we don't always feel all that good about them. Sometimes to do what we think is right we end up hurting, albeit unintentionally, someone else. Even worse, sometimes we hurt someone doing what we think is right and then find out later that we were wrong. And that, as Aristotle would say, just plain sucks.But it is the imperfect, wonderful world we all live in. Which brings me to AMC's fantastic 'The Killing'. A Danish import, 'Killing' follows the murder investigation of young woman in Seattle, Washington. The story is told in thirteen 1 hour episodes through the perspectives of the people whose lives are impacted by the murder and subsequent investigation, with special emphasis on lead investigator Sarah Linden (played picture-perfect by Mireille Enos). Amazingly, despite a fairly large cast, there is nary a flat character to be found. All the players are fleshed out, fully realized people with deep complexity and back-story. This allows the show to rise above a simple whodunit police procedural and really delve into just what a murder means to the people in the victim's life. It is alternately dark and gritty, inspirational, and heart breaking to watch these people cope with the loss and fear that surrounds this girls murder.And that brings me back to my original point. The reason I love this show so much is because, unlike the many many many police procedurals out there, it is no fairy tale with all the bad guys punished and good guys victorious. It makes you wallow in the mud with the characters, encouraging you to feel all the frustration and confusion that they feel. It makes you want what they want, only to remind you that even good people and good decisions have consequences that are far less than ideal. This is the kind of show that you think about after it's over, asking yourself if you would have done this or that differently. But that deeply unsettled feeling you get is the digestive price you pay for such a rich, not-written-for-kids storyline, and is so worth it. There is really nothing quite like it on TV right now; I highly recommend it.",

The main characters are a couple of slackers in their twenties who live only for the moment, even if that means getting fired. They constantly get into trouble due to their irresponsibility, but always manage to end up on top through some hilarious twist.That said...Regular Show is rated PG, not G, not Y7. Every time I read a negative review for this show, someone is whining about how Cartoon Network should feel ashamed for making such a vulgar children's program. Newsflash, just because it's a cartoon doesn't mean it's for kids. Family Guy has already proved that. There is a warning ahead of time that underage viewers require parental guidance, PG. Personally, I'd say it's about as raunchy as Ren and Stimpy or Rocko's Modern Life and Rocko was very, very raunchy, hence the deletion of certain scenes during re-runs. And who can forget Chokey Chicken, hm? If you're a grown up, give it a chance. If you're a grown up with kids who wanna watch it, consider their age and go from there.

Does that take away from the brilliant plot and acting? I don't think anything in film or television is an accurate portrayal of anything. If someone were to rewrite this exciting show into an \"accurate portrayal\" of law, then it would just be a show about Viola Davis filling out paper work and occasionally showing up in court. And some of these reviewers go on to say that it is a shame that people believe that is how the court of law is in real life. My advice to them is to go to the IMDb page of the Avengers and write a review that says, \"it's a shame that every single person who watches this movie now believes superheroes actually exist,\" because apparently no one who is a consumer of media entertainment has the common sense to know that lawyers do not, in reality, go around killing and bribing everyone. No one watches a show like How to Get Away with Murder for a lesson in law, they watch it for the interesting characters and fascinating plot. I had to write this review to correct all of the mistaken reviews that gave this show anything less than a 7, because the overall rating of this show was dismaying to me.

    "critic_rating": "7.3", 
    "top_review": "Razor sharp comedy starring Ted Danson might not appeal to everyone, given its focus on a cantankerous and highly grumpy doctor, but the script is incredibly strong.Becker is a traditional style sitcom, much in the blend of the popular ones which went before it like Frasier and Cheers. Like Frasier, it stars a major actor from Cheers, in this case Ted Danson, but otherwise shares absolutely nothing with it and certainly isn't a follow-up. The only other thing the 2 share is that the star of Frasier, Kelsey Grammar, also features in a cameo in an episode of it.The situation part of the 'sitcom' of Becker is that John Becker, a slightly bitter and abrasively outspoken doctor has set up a crummy practice in the middle of New York's Bronx. Suffering the 'morons' of regular society makes his attitude decline by the day and he constantly preaches his rants at Reggie's Diner where both his best friend Jake (Who's blind) runs a newspaper stall, and Bob the amiable pest hang out.Becker also lives alone in a fairly seedy apartment where the rest of the block's residents universally loathe him.Add his long suffering surgery assistant Margaret who's basically his rock, and the dipsy 'receptionist' Linda and you have the overall picture.Sure, this doesn't perhaps sound all that original or even inspiring to any degree on paper, but bring it to life with a sharp script and quality actors and you have one of the finest comedies it's been my personal pleasure to witness.To say Danson *is* Becker is the understatement of the year. He has created a character with complete life here, and embodies what he represents absolutely perfectly. His line delivery is totally spot on and he commands every scene such is his definite presence. Now when looking at him I see Becker, and not Sam Malone.The other characters are pretty good as well, even Bob, who after simply getting on our nerves to start with eventually grows on you. Jake is extremely well played by Alex Desert as well, managing to portray a fairly decent level of vulnerability while trying to be as tough as possible. The only matter of taste with a blind character in a sitcom are the inevitable jokes at the expense of said blindness. Subsequently, it goes without saying that Becker is *not* PC - at times some of the gags can be slightly offensive, but nothing is ever truly over the score.However, next to Becker the best character was the simply fantastic Reggie, who was played by Terry Farrel up until she was bizarrely fired based on reasons of 'creative direction' late on in the show's run by the producers. She gave the show a touch of glamour, but we identified with her because she never seemed to have anything go for her, and yet soldiered on in a state of light despair. Farrel captured her brilliantly, and her loss was felt big time. The replacement, Chris, was OK, but simply nowhere near in the league of Reggie.However, this is an aside; the strength of Becker is and was the quality of the script. The dialogue was, at times, acidly delicious with razor sharp wit. In fact, most of the time it was like this. Becker's constant rantings might be repetitive, but they were always funny because we can actually relate to the aspects of life which got his goat up so much. Furthermore, while he was shown as a cantankerous old git, Danson gave him plenty of self-deprecating moments too. Not only did we laugh at what he said, we laughed at his situations and the amusing body language he emitted regularly.His practice was also a massive character in itself, with patients combining hypochondria and hemorrhoids much to the amusement of the viewer.The other characters got plenty of hilarious lines as well, so this wasn't just the Ted Danson show, and consequently it was an extremely well-rounded show and not relying on any one character. But, as Farrel's absence later on showed, all of the main characters were vital. Bob was also written out for season 6, and his replacement Hector simply didn't fit in at all.Despite these drawbacks, up till the chopping and changing, the show ran seamlessly and hilariously smoothly. It's a testament to the script that even *without* the main characters, although we didn't like their replacements, they still made us laugh. Overall it's a superb comedy, and it's a rank pity it wasn't more levied by the Americans, many of whom seemed oblivious to its existence.Said one: \"Becker? The German tennis guy? I didn't even know that he had his own show,\" \"Is it on BBC America or something?\"...",

The diner used to be run by Reggie Kostas, but it has been taken over by Chris Conner, a lady whom Becker fluctuates between loathing and being attracted to. The diner is also frequented by Robert Benito, who is universally known as Bob and is the super at Becker's apartment (much to the doctor's regret).",

It's the first show that I don't sit down to watch with the sole anticipation of having it either cheer me up with comedy or shock me with dramatic twists. 'Louie' is simply something I watch because it feels like I'm gaining life experience from it, which is impressive considering Louis C.K., or at least the Louie character's self-proclaimed life goals are to raise his kids and hold his title as World's Best Masturbator.It's also impressive considering that I, and I'm sure many viewers, have already experienced nearly every situation this show covers, from being forced out of the house with no plans to being on a date with someone who thinks less of you for doing the right thing despite saying that he/she valued righteousness. So what's to gain from reliving these unpleasant situations every Tuesday evening? Great shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm bank on this question by allowing the main character to vengefully act on his everyday irritations only to have it bite him in the ass by the episode's end. This way you can laugh at the absurdity while saying, \"I know what he's feeling, man,\" followed by, \"but I'm sure glad *I* didn't act on it.\" It's a winning formula because the audience always comes out unscathed. 'Louie' makes that show look like it's playing too safe (which it isn't, by the way.)If the Louie character ever acts on his irritations, he does it in a way that almost feels like he's seen Curb, and thus trying to avoid any unnecessary harm while still following his gut instinct. In other words, he's a coward sometimes, just like we are. Curb's Larry David states in interviews that his eponymous character is more like him than he is. Louie is simply Louis, and perhaps, Louis is simply everybody, and PERHAPS that can be a little discomforting. But that's okay, because at least, just like when we look back on mistakes or simply situations that we wish we could have handled differently (so that we could've gotten laid that night), it's almost always hilarious. The difference here is that it's *always* hilarious. . . though it's still unbelievably discomforting. For that, I'm more than happy to not save my ass on this one. Enjoy chewing on it, critics.",

I was somewhat skeptical at first, given the short lived rise and fall of the secret circle, but I can't help but feel like this show really has some great potential, and will remain a must-see in your weekly TV rota. With very charmed-like characters and an immediate fondness for the protagonists, my intrigue was surely hooked.Alongside the endearing and oh-so-steamy cast is a thorough and well developed story-line of family, betrayal and of course, magic! Gone are the days where you will underwhelmed by low budget special effects shaping shiny blue lights and glitter that falls from the sky. From what we have seen so far they have really implemented intelligent and effective directing to encapsulate the thrills associated with magic and bring some justice back to this witchy genre. All in all, this series is worth keeping an eye on, I'm seeing some good things here and cant wait for the series to continue even further.",

It was funny but never THAT funny, or at least so I thought, because when I got into my twenties and the show vanished from Norwegian television - low and behold - I went and ordered the 3 first seasons of the internet! So I guess I was more addicted to it than I cared to admit at first :)The basic idea of making fun of Nazis never seem to grow old, or in the case of this show: making fun of the Gestapo. The rest of the Germans come off as almost sympathetic and lovable at times, but I mean: how can anyone hate the closet-gay officer Lt. Gruber and his \"little tank\"? The show is really classic comedy, especially in the way that much of the laughs rely heavily on the fun of repeated catchphrases (\"It is I, Leclerc!\" - \"Good moaning!\" \"Listen carefully, I shall say this only once\" etc) and some truly crazy antics. It IS at times *very* funny and some of the goings-on in this German occupied French village really has to be seen to be believed!One of my favorite characters is Officer Crabtree, a British undercover-agent posing as a French police-officer, which is quite impressive considering his French makes Inspector Closeau sound like a professor in linguistics. One of his lines that has followed me since I was about 14 was \"The French pissants are hiding in the German shiteu\" (you figure it out).So there you have it, if you like the subject of WWII and British comedy \"Allo Allo\" should be your 'cap of toe' (as Officer Crabtree probably would call it).",

    "top_review": "\"Faking It\" is, of course, MTV's new scripted teen comedy series, following the unwanted departure of \"The Hard Times of RJ Berger\" and on the heels of the wildly popular \"Awkward.\" (the best scripted comedy series MTV has put out in the last four years and which I sadly suspect may be on its way off the air and into television oblivion once this new season is up).Like everything else MTV, \"Faking It\" is comic, edgy trashiness of the first degree; in the 21st century, comic and edgy trashiness of the first degree is an absolute must for modern television programming, especially when it comes to MTV. And yet, like \"Awkward.\" and \"Hard Times,\" there's something oddly compelling about it, even moving.Because it's only the first episode, a brief synopsis should be sufficient: life-long best friends - the social-climbing, un-ironically named Karma Ashcroft (Katie Stevens) and her gal-pal, the cynical, straight-laced Amy Raudenfeld (Rita Volk) - are a pair of desperate wannabes looking to fit into their liberal-minded, open and socially accepting Austin, Texas, high school, where even they appear to be outsiders desperately looking to join in on the club.Before you know it, a series of misunderstandings and innuendos unexpectedly propels both girls into the celebrity limelight, where they are mistakenly \"outed\" as, and thus decide to pretend to be, lesbians, much to the satisfaction of the openly gay king bee Shane Harvey (Michael Willett), and the detriment of their mutual nemesis and resident mean girl/wannabe queen bee Lauren Cooper (Bailey Buntain), who is also Amy's new step-sister.My impression from this first episode is that \"Faking It\" looks quite promising. \"Faking It\" looks to be an inspired take on the lengths we'll go to \"fake it\" in order to just fit in, bullying, intolerance, and 21st-century political-correctness. This goes to show that like \"Awkward.\" and \"The Hard Times of RJ Berger,\" and just because it's MTV, it may not be as dumb as it appears to be at first.To their credit, and to our amazement, \"Faking It\" looks to do the impossible, and that is to be a scripted MTV teen comedy series that actually says something about our 21st-century perceptions of tolerance and acceptance (that it's even saying something at all is a magical feat in and of itself).Things are looking good, so far...8/10",

In the first few seasons, several episodes featured creative and delightful gimmicks. Although creatively the series sagged a bit in the \"middle years,\" the last two seasons showed a resurgence in quality.  Throughout the series' twelve years, however, very few episodes failed to deliver in terms of the mystery itself: it's always fun to try to find the clues and deduce their meaning before the detective does, but if you don't, it's also fun to hear the explanation.Although there are several lovable recurring characters, the only real regular in the series is Angela Lansbury.  Consequently, the format is refreshingly free, and the writers aren't forced to bog the stories down for a boatload of regulars.  However, there are always plenty of interesting characters acting as suspects.  Frequently there are famous beloved older guest stars, especially in the first few seasons, but the special guest star is not always the killer; the mystery always comes first!  This is an old-fashioned mystery series, unmarred by an overdose of violence or melodrama.  Plus, Jessica Fletcher is a character that one can't help but love, and Angela Lansbury plays it to charming perfection.There is, of course, the obvious creative license: that Jessica Fletcher always accidentally stumbles across a murder.  If you are willing to put this aside, this is a show one can really enjoy.  (Note: The show pokes fun at itself on occasion, including one where Jessica reveals that she is nicknamed \"the Bloody Mary of murder.\")",

I will try to look for them as best I can.Generally speaking, CatDog involves a cat and dog attached to each other. They encounter funny moments and stupid adventures. CatDog wasn't strong on humor, but it was good on voice acting, and the character presentation.This was a very good show, in my opinion.

Well I attack with my dark magician!\" or \"Now I shall harness the power of all millennium items and rule the world!\" or \"Ha ha, with the power of our friendship we will defeat you!\"  However, after I had been forced to actually watch several episodes and began to actually follow the plot and character development, I discovered to my surprise that this show, while it is basically just a marketing ploy to sell trading cards, is actually a complex and fascinating story with well-developed and multi-dimensional characters and relationships.Now, granted, you have to have certain tolerances to enjoy this show: you have to accept the world in which the characters live, in which for some reason everything seems to ride on this certain card game, Duel Monsters, and in which there exist ancient items with various spirits trapped inside them.  If you're inclined to dismiss the premises of the plot as stupid, then this show is not for you.  Secondly, you have to tolerate the fact that much of the show consists of duels, in which the characters themselves compete in the card game that the show is designed to market.  It helps if you're a 6 to 12-year-old boy (or anyone else, I suppose) and are actually into playing the card game yourself.  Or, like me, you can simply realize that the game actually is quite interesting and complex, and in the show is used to advance the plot and character development, and just accept it. Finally, you have to tolerate a certain amount of sappiness--the main characters do often take the time to go on and on about the importance of friendship and courage and standing up for yourself, etc etc...however, I personally find this somewhat refreshing after watching my brother play countless video games where the main message seemed to be Kill Anything in Your Path if It Will Give You Energy Points or some such advantage.  And the character relationships are complex enough that these speeches, when they occur, are actually meaningful and sometimes (at least to me!) quite touching.The point is, don't dismiss this show.  The animation is crisp and nuanced (except for occasionally when they decide for some reason to switch to exaggerated, cartoon-like animation, particularly with Joey--those moments are probably my least favorite aspect of the show!), and the characters are real, touching, and very entertaining.

    "top_review": "In our household we are all Trekkies, so the ongoing adventures of the Federation Star Ship Enterprise constantly enthrall us. My husband will stubbornly watch only TOS, while my teenage son feels nostalgic about TOS, but secretly prefers Voyager. As for myself, while I find some of the Next Generation plots compelling and enjoy the dangerous drama of Voyager stranded in the Delta Quadrant, there's nothing quite like the characters from TOS. The series has an innocence about it unmatched in the later ones. My compliments to the late Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek's creator.Captain James T. Kirk is the audacious, impulsive, and womanizing Enterprise commander. In almost every episode he has some gorgeous new love interest, seldom exhibiting much restraint! Kirk frequently engages in physical hand to hand combat with his opponents, torn shirt & sweat being common. Yet he does manage to come up with some bold and brilliant moves such as his legendary ruse, the Corbomite Manouever. Perhaps his primary task is serving as referee between the constantly sparring First Officer Spock and ship's doctor, Bones McCoy.The heart of the series is Mr. Spock, the half Vulcan First Officer and ship's Science Officer. Actually however, Spock would maintain that he is the HEAD of the series, since he prides himself on his unfailing logic and lack of emotion. The inner conflict between his logic driven paternal Vulcan half and his emotional maternal human half form an ongoing theme. Spock possesses two useful Vulcan abilities, the neck pinch and the mind meld. The most engaging character interaction is between the logic motivated Spock versus the highly emotional ship's physician, Dr. Leonard (Bones) McCoy, who is basically a country doctor in space, a humanitarian leery of all this newfangled gadgetry. McCoy is famous in the Trek world for his expression, 'I'm a doctor, not a ----' (many phrases have been used here).Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott is a hot tempered Scotsman with a fondness for his native country's whiskey. Scotty constantly bemoans that he 'cannae change the laws of physics' all the while working assorted engineering miracles with the warp core and anti matter this or that. As for Communications Officer Uhura, she is most notable for her regular phrase, 'Hailing frequencies open, Sir.' To be sure, some of the episodes have less than brilliant plots, notably Spock's Brain, though the character interactions always compensate for any inadequacies. However, some ideas were masterful, including The Enterprise Incident, The Menagerie, and City on the Edge of Forever. The series took on issues of overpopulation (The Mark of Gideon), social class disparity (The Cloud Minders, with its clever cloud city, Stratos), and racism (Let That Be Your Last Battlefield), which involves laughable hatred between two races, one black on the left side & white on the right, the other race vice versa. I personally enjoyed The Naked Time (Nurse Chappel admits her love for Spock), A Taste of Armageddon (computer war), This Side of Paradise (Spock frolics), and Is There in Truth No Beauty? (the Medusan ambassador's incredible ugliness causes madness in the hapless onlooker). However, my absolute favourite is unquestionably the absurd Amok Time, with Spock's ridiculous pon farr mating strife.The Enterprise crew consists of a racially diverse group, with its black Communications Officer Uhura and Oriental helmsman Sulu. The ship's navigator, Chekov, is Russian...quite a revolutionary idea for that Cold War era. The cast are perfect in their roles, including William Shatner (Kirk), Leonard Nimoy (Spock), and all the others. Special tribute to the late Deforest Kelly (McCoy) and James Doohan (Scotty), who are sadly missed. This is the series that gave us such technologies as the transporter, tricorder, and cloaking device...high tech weaponry including phasers and photon torpedoes...futuristic games like three dimensional chess...miracle drugs such as cordrazine...and gourmet delicacies like Saurian brandy & Romulan ale. Some of the gadgetry gave a sneak preview of such later real life technology as computer floppy discs. In addition to the highly logical Vulcans, Star Trek gave us glimpses of such alien species as the honour driven Klingons and the sneaky Romulans (the Federation's two primary enemies), also the xenophobic Tholians, the reptilian Gorn, and many others. It treated us to the endearing rock like, silicon based Horta and the cute & fuzzy but all too prolific Tribbles (which caused no end of Trouble). And it acquainted us with such planets as Sarpeidon, Eminiar & Vendikar.In the episode Metamorphosis, we were all introduced to the heroic Zephram Cochrane who invented the warp drive way back in 2063. In constant demand is the dilithium vital to the warp engine's functioning. Star Trek also acquainted us with the United Federation of Planets, Starfleet & Starfleet Academy, and the Federation's much vaunted strict rule called the Prime Directive, which is frequently mentioned but universally ignored! Star Trek is simply an incredibly fun and entertaining science fiction series, though it was hardly appreciated back in the 1960's when it originally aired. Fortunately, it lives on today in re runs, giving Trekkies the ongoing excitement of regularly 'boldly going where no man has gone before'. Live long and prosper, everyone!",

In addition they work in themes that are important but they never beat you over the head with them. So far i have seen stories on the ease of getting guns and how they harm society, child abuse, pedophiles, and racism. But I never feel I am being preached to. The episode about the little boy sold into sexual slavery by his uncle and the tragic way this evil pedophile ruined his and others lives will stay with me forever. It was very heartbreaking. The opening credits and the great music by ES Posthumus ( as well as the songs that set the time, place and mood throughout the episodes) are eerie and evocative and just wonderful.

    "top_review": "Let me start this review by stating that I've never read the comic books, so I can't testify as to whether or not this crazy, grotesque, violent and hilarious new AMC fantasy series is a faithful adaptation of the source material. But what I can tell you as an avid fantasy and horror fan is that the pilot left me with an immediate urge to watch the next episode.Just so you know, this review won't contain anything story related, so if you want to learn what the show is about, read the IMDb synopsis or go to Wikipedia. I believe most films and TV-shows are enjoyed best without knowing anything other than maybe the genre, cast or filmmaker (plus, personally, I like to know about as many aspects as I can about the actual quality of the filmmaking itself). Oh, but maybe this: don't get frustrated if you don't immediately understand just what the heck is going on. The pilot introduces several key characters and important story elements by jumping around quite a bit and throwing you directly into the action, but we're clearly not meant to know and understand everything right from the start. So relax, be patient and have a little faith in showrunner Sam Catlin; the dude co-produced (or co-executive produced) 55 episodes of 'Breaking Bad', 10 of which he wrote, so he should know a little something about storytelling. What becomes immediately evident in 'Preacher' is that the casting of the title role was a stroke of genius: Dominic Cooper ('The Devil's Double', 'Captain America: The First Avenger') makes for a fantastic lead. His charismatic but nuanced performance as conflicted preacher Jesse Custer was enough to convince me after only one episode that he will be able to carry this series. It's always a balancing act to portray this kind of character with just enough vulnerability to make him appear relatable and human but still have him come across as larger than life, and judging by what I've seen so far, Cooper manages to pull it off perfectly.I'd say the cast in general is very solid, but the two actors that need to be mentioned most apart from Cooper's preacher are Ruth Negga in the role of Tulip and Joseph Gilgun who plays Cassidy. Both are wicked fun to watch (and obviously they're relishing their parts) and both have completely bonkers introduction scenes for their respective characters that will give audiences a taste of just what kind of crazy, ultra-violent mayhem we're in for with this new show.Now just to get this straight: there are darkly comic moments abound in 'Preacher' but it is not a black comedy - nor is it as over the top as, say, 'Ash vs the Evil Dead' (despite being pretty over the top at times). Fans of the show's creators, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, would be well-advised not to expect a similar tone in 'Preacher' as in some of the duo's previous works like 'This Is the End' or 'The Interview'. What we have here is probably best described as \"dark fantasy\" and while it IS peppered with a large dose of dark comedy, I'm pretty sure there will also be some rather unfunny sh\u00eet down the road for this preacher to deal with.As for the production values, the visuals (and the visual effects) in general look very nice and the sets convincing; the southern locations have a \"lived-in\" and appropriately run-down look and the whole small-town, Texan atmosphere is tangible. The cinematography was expertly done (the pilot's DoP was none other than The Matrix' Bill Pope) and the soundtrack is even downright fantastic (if you can appreciate southern songs from the likes of Johnny Cash, that is). The one thing that didn't always work for me was the pacing/editing and the way certain scenes were established, but a slightly uneven rhythm is not uncommon for pilot episodes, so I'm not worried yet.My overall verdict: 'Preacher' is a show that doesn't try for a second to cater to a mainstream audience; it offers a unique blend of pulp elements and dark fantasy for genre fans who most likely won't have the slightest problem digesting the hefty mix of drama, horror, gory violence and humor. Needless to say, I'm totally on board (and I can't wait for the next sermon). My provisional rating: 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

Initially, it was about an eccentric time-traveller from another planet, who looked human and affected an English manner and style. The interior of his time machine (called a TARDIS) was huge and highly advanced, but the exterior quaintly resembled an English public call box. The Doctor was a self-imposed exile from a race of powerful beings called the Time Lords. The Time Lords observed history, but never interfered with it. This bored the almighty heck out of the Doctor, so he made off with an older TARDIS and decided to see the Universe for himself. When the original actor who played the Doctor decided to leave the show, the writers came up with the inventive concept of `regeneration'. Whenever the Doctor was close to death, or actually killed, he would `regenerate' into a new body (and persona). The show went through seven highly talented actors in this fashion.The format of the show was highly adaptable. Didn't like the way the show was going? Just wait two or three years. The style always seemed to change whenever there was a change of Doctor, producer and/or script editor. The series went from educational children's drama to monster show to intelligent adult sci-fi/drama to gothic horror to high camp, et cetera, et cetera, and so forth.This was a wonderful, imaginative, fun show when it was on. I was sad to see it go.",

The Doctor has a soft spot for the planet Earth, and often visits there, either to save it from various alien threats or to whisk a choice few inhabitants away to the distant parts of the galaxy to help him fight evil there.

Misfits is very unique and while you can guess some plot lines of the show, you can never guess what'll happen next episode.What Misfits provides is a group of interesting, likable and believable characters involved in well thought-out stories that are not over-complicated but still challenge the audience.To complete the show, the episodes are also full of thick, dark humour.Overall, it is an excellent show.",

(Unlike virtually all other famous fictional creations, Tintin's adventures on film, TV and radio have all come from Herge's work - in accordance with his wishes, no one's allowed to concoct new stories now that the original creator is dead.)Of course, there were a few tweaks made to bring Tintin, Captain Haddock, the Thompson Twins, Professor Calculus, Signora Bianca Castafiore and the rest to television this time, but nothing story-wrecking (in the adaptation of \"The Broken Ear,\" the two villains of the piece are brought to justice alive - in the book they drown and go to Hell). The writers, animators and voice cast preserve the spirit of the tales wonderfully; Tintin may speak with a Canadian voice, but so what? It's not like the series has been thoroughly butchered.

    "top_review": "NBC was already a monster by 1985 thanks to programs like \"The Cosby Show\", \"Cheers\" and \"L.A. Law\" (all part of that unbeatable Thursday lineup). In 1985 it appeared that Beatrice Arthur (who struck gold with \"Maude\", a spin-off of \"All in the Family\") was going back to television in a new show called \"The Golden Girls\". Along with Arthur (a smart-mouthed Brooklyn native) was her old-world Sicilian mother (Estelle Getty), a bubble-headed Minnesota native (Betty White) and a sex-crazed belle from Georgia (Rue McClanahan). This quartet of actresses would create the finest core of performers to ever star in a television series. \"The Golden Girls\", unlike \"Cheers\", was a hit from its first episode. It dominated with vigor and spunk on Saturday nights. NBC was worried that the show would never find an audience big enough to make a dent in the ratings, but for a time \"The Golden Girls\" was as excellent as anything else the networks had to offer. The four women, all obviously over 50, lived, laughed and cried together in Miami for nearly a decade from 1985 to 1992. The series pushed the envelope on everything that dominated headlines during its run (AIDS, homosexuality, sexism, ageism, political unrest, abortion and an endless list of other topics too long to go into at length). The episodes went for comedy, but usually almost always had a deep meaning to them about love and friendship. All four actresses shared the spotlight equally for the most part. Arthur and McClanahan had hit gold with \"Maude\" and White had been along seemingly at the advent of television programming. Getty was relatively unknown, but fit in well with more-established performers immediately (her character got away with more than the others as she was written as a lady who had suffered a major stroke which affected the relationship between what she said and thought). Herb Edelman (who made a name for himself in \"The Odd Couple\") was always a consistent element as Arthur's two-timing ex-husband and Harold Gould (who was a key player in \"The Sting\") also became a fixture during the series' latter episodes as White's love interest. Like all good things though, \"The Golden Girls\" began to slowly lose their edge and appeal by the early-1990s. Time slot changes and constant contract re-negotiations ended the series far too early. Arthur's want to leave the show by 1992 would ultimately kill the program. CBS attempted to bring the other three back with \"The Golden Palace\", but that series never found its legs without Arthur. 5 stars out of 5.",

    "top_review": "Peaky Blinders is one of the most unique British dramas ever made. I would even go as far as to say TV history in the making. Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham. The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard. As is the quality of acting, which is undeniably as good as you'll find in any prime-time British drama.Even though people on this particular forum have not had much positive feedback about the series, believe me, the connoisseurs of this genre have been very impressed thus far. Furthermore, the show seems to be building up to climatic ending rather than simply documenting a day in the life of a Peaky Blinder. The more observant viewers will see subtle 'tie-ins' between each situation and be able to follow the flow of events without obvious prediction. This is what the drama audience thrives on to stimulate analytical debate after each episode.If it doesn't get rave reviews, I will be disappointed but not surprised, as Peaky Blinders has all the makings of an artistic and timeless cult series, possibly appealing more to purists and true fans of the cult/gangster genre.

DJ, Stefanie and Kimmi are back, now as grown ups where DJ needs to raise her 3 sons by herself, and of course require help. Danny, Jessie and Joey are also back, mainly as guest stars im guessing throughout the season. The show starts fresh with frequent recalls of events of the older show, the director even gives us split screen scenes with both the new and older show scenes playing. Subtle funny moments and not going over the top as i was expecting, with hilarious puns and jokes from the older show. The family battle newer challenges with their newer kids like the obsession with electronic tablets, etc Sadly, there is no Michelle, that the whole cast acknowledge in quite a funny way during the first episode! Who knows, she might be brought back in the future. In summary, such a great, heartwarming and funny reboot for the whole family to enjoy",

    "top_review": "With 1998's \"Cowboy Bebop\", one of the most acclaimed anime TV series ever (go read the comments index for it here on IMDb if you don't believe me!), Shinichiro Watanabe became a creative force to watch out for. The innovative energy, drama and beauty of \"Bebop\" are carried forward in his second original series, \"Samurai Champloo\". Fans have been quick to look for similarities between \"Bebop\" and \"Champloo\" (even the titles have clear parallels), and it's true there are some: the assembly-of-rootless-loners cast of characters, the dramatic and cinematic visual style, and especially the importance and integration of music into the storytelling mix--in SC's case, everything from hip-hop beatboxing to Ainu and Okinawan folksong. But \"Champloo\"'s differences from \"Bebop\" are much more interesting than its likenesses. \"Bebop\" is drenched in melancholy and regret, dreams of the lost past and the future that couldn't be. \"Champloo\" is all about facing the future, the wave of change, the onrush of history that can't be stopped, and how three kids from widely diverse backgrounds--not even friends when they set out-- find themselves right on the crest of that wave. We're in Edo Period Japan; since 1638 the Tokugawa Shogunate has banned contact with all countries except China and Japan, a ban that lasted two centuries. The outside world can't be kept outside forever. Even the long-respected samurai class is losing its power, and there's restlessness in the land plus accompanying pressure from the Shogunate on all sides. Through this uneasy landscape (rendered in lushly beautiful watercolors that might remind you of Miyazaki) wander our cast of characters: outlaw ronin Jin, a gifted swordsman, stoic, disciplined and heartbreakingly gorgeous, devoted to the bushido code but exiled for killing his sensei; Okinawan wild-boy Mugen, orphan, former pirate and brilliant innovator, whose fighting style mixes everything from Brazilian capoeira to break-dancing, and whose feral-child innocence faces the toughest tests in the series; and teahouse waitress Fuu, spunky, compassionate and packing a lot of secrets, who rescues the two swordsmen from the executioner's block and enlists them on her quest to avenge her mother's death. On their long walk from Edo to Nagasaki they'll see a lot, face a lot of trials, starve, quarrel, save each other's lives, break up, re-bond, and become inseparable. Except that Jin and Mugen still swear they'll fight to the death one day, and no one (not even Fuu) is saying anything about the Sunflower Samurai, the object of Fuu's quest.Have I made this sound like a straight historical drama? I ought to mention that it can be hysterically funny as well as vividly bloody, contains knockout fight scenes and anachronisms by the carload (the aforementioned break dancing and beatboxing, Jin's Armani glasses, the appearance of landmarks not built till the 1900s...), has made me cry more times than any anime since \"Bebop\", and has sharp things to say about the heavy hand of authority and tradition on groups as diverse as gay men, married women, foreigners, aboriginal natives and illegal aliens. It's unfailingly beautiful to look at (well, 95% unfailingly) and listen to, delectably well-written, and simply brilliant. When it gets to America, go find it.",

You teenagers out there, do you remember Conklin and Boynton? Or Lily Ruskin and Hilda Crocker? How about Cosmo and Henrietta Topper?

The show is about a lawyer who hits a fork in the road and attempting to get back to the basics of what life is about.The show is kitschy and silly and funny but sorta sweet too. And yet every review here so far is about like 10 minutes of courtroom drama that I don't take anymore seriously than the courtroom drama with \"Law And Order!\" Give people more credit-most of us realize the storyline is just that-a storyline.And it's very, very, very unfortunate that some organized campaign to take this show down by people just because of a 10 minute story line from an hour show!

Gooding is reactive and unsophisticated, while the cocksure Simpson is just missing. This is an incredible failure of casting where the remaining characters are spot on and compelling. Why not Dwayne Johnson or someone with the physical charisma and cool? Travolta deserves great kudos for taking this on, but one has to wonder why he allowed the utter miscasting of the major role.

So far, I haven't seen anything worth watching, until The Paradise came on. It has the same gentle feel that Lark Rise did, and the same idea of having pride in the work you do. It is really nice to have a TV show which is not obsessed with having nude scenes in it, or using swear words at every turn, but rather concentrating on a good script, and a storyline that makes you want to know what is going to happen next. Some of the characters do feel like they need to find themselves a little bit, but since this is the first series, I think that they can easily be forgiven for that!

And they unfortunately confuse it with bad acting in their reviews. Well, well...To me that mistake never became a problem. Then again, I am myself a person with a Autistic spectrum of High-functioning type (HFA). A \"near cousin\" to Asperger. And I was simply stunned. Sofia Helins interpretation of a police-officer with Autistic spectrum of Asperger type was just excellent. Maybe not perfect, but excellent. And it is without a doubt one of the best performances I've ever seen, made by an non-autistic actress/actor. (Watch out, Dustin Hoffman *wink*)The chemistry between the actress/actor Sofia Helin and Kim Bodnia are excellent as well. I'm actually not going to say anything about the plot itself. It would be wasteful. Just be aware that the female police-officer in the series actually is a person with Autistic spectrum of Asperger type (for less confusion), see the show, and be amazed.

I'm fairly new to the world of anime, but I have to say from what I've seen that Death Note goes above and beyond your typical run-of-the-mill action based anime. Whereas a lot of anime strategically relies on action packed battles and fights, Death Note is a refreshing change of pace. It's slick, clever, and witty with the eccentric \"L\" heading the investigation. It's a constant game of cat and mouse as the lead investigator and the suspected \"Kira\" or \"Killer\" always seem to be one step ahead of one another. The two brilliant minds constantly outwit each other. The plot is complex but easily laid out for you and the story is remarkably intelligent and inventive. All the while you're watching you think, \"Wow, this can't possibly get any deeper,\" but each new episode proves you wrong. What I like the most is that this is very, very complex material but it's flawlessly and easily presented so each new development in the case comes as an excited shock.This is great stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be looking for a change of pace in anime. It's not for everyone, of course since it's more of an intellectual thriller and not so much an action fantasy, but anyone who can appreciate the mental challenge of following along with this suspenseful battle of wits will be in heaven with Death Note.",

US users ratings: 3.6, so far.The above is a very important piece of information, to make up your mind as to the actual quality of this series.I've only watched the first episode so I'll make it short. I thought this dark BBC thriller was not only original, but extremely well filmed, suspenseful, realistic (real northern Irish actors and Gillian Anderson a word perfect English lady, in what clearly is Belfast itself), very well acted all round. It is not a whodunit, we're made to follow from the start both a MET detective and a serial killer's lives, as one tries to figure out, find and catch the other, and the other one fights his addiction to rape and kill on a daily basis. The tone is dark, the story is very chilling, but that's only because the protagonists are so very...ordinary. They could be us, any one of us.It's nice to see a story set in Belfast that is NOT about the troubles, (even though there are - few - references and slang words only local to the north)I really hope this carries on in the same vein throughout the next 4 episodes. While both series have nothing in common, it reminded me of that enthralling underrated gem Ultraviolet, another left-field BBC masterpiece that still has a dedicated following to this day.10/10 for episode 1, can't think of anything yet to even give it a 9 to be honest.Update episode 2, 10/10. Unexpected twists! Update episode 3: 10/10; Infinite shades of grey. Update episode 4: 10/10; I'm bolting my front door and double-checking all the windows. Update episode 5: 8/10. A slightly weaker link to the next season, which I can't wait for, now.I must add a warning for sensitive people: There are a few graphic, realistic, upsetting scenes.",

His blunt matter of fact, tell-it-like-is approach to telling the unvarnished truth to the no-talent wannabes who audition is something I find very refreshing. Especially when their egos and attitudes are directly proportional to the extent that they suck -- meaning the more they suck, the more ego and attitude they tend to have. (Not with all, but certainly a lot of them) Then there are others who don't have attitude and are devastated by criticism and can be seen in tears later, and even if they were bad I feel a little sorry for them. But that's simply the reality, of the music business and if these kids can't handle it, then they shouldn't be trying to forge a career as a musical artist.That's reality, and Simon gives them this much needed reality check. It's reality TV in every sense of the word.",

This does not mean that the movie is distasteful, on the contrary, there is some kind of strange beauty associated with the violence which results in a mix of sadness and melancholy that stays with one long after watching the movie. I did not see too many anime to have an authoritative opinion on this, but I believe that the excellent soundtrack is also one of the sources of the emotional blend of sweet and bitter atmosphere in the movie. The theme of the anime is sung in Latin, has a heavenly sweet voice sing a deeply sad song. The theme is associated with the intro and ending clips, which being symbolically very rich, adds a strong sense of magic and mystery to it. One of the nice parts, and maybe also of the sources of strong emotions associated with the movie is the way in which the director develops some of the main characters in such a way that they are complete. They have good parts and they have bad parts, they love and they hate. You love them at times and then you hate them at other times. And because you get to know them pretty well, you will eventually get involved to the point that you really fear for their fate.Besides being complete, the characters are idealized and put in deep emotionally situations: they risk their lives for their loved ones, they die for their loved ones, they hurt for their lost ones, they cry, they laugh with joy and everything at the highest level of involvement. Maybe this is why we like them: in a way they are so much more alive than us!Inocence and pain, beauty and menace, death and love, blood and hope, all these make from Elfen Lied an addictive series which will leave a long-lasting impression on you.

    "critic_rating": "7.5", 
    "top_review": "There's been many shows over the years featuring a nomadic character who helps people as he goes about his journey, but THE PRETENDER is probably my favorite of the bunch. Whereas in other shows the character was always the same, this series added a twist: he was a genius with the ability to assume any profession he chose, from park ranger to FBI special agent. I'm surprised he never posed as an astronaut and went into space. Michael T. Weiss was terrific as the title character, Jarod, who helps right wrongs as he attempts to find the parents he was taken from as a child and continually eludes those chasing him from the mysterious organization from where he's escaped. Because of his ability, each episode was like an individual little movie, because he was someone different each week. And one of the things I liked was the way he would get revenge. Rather than just go for the person, he would slowly toy with them, taking his plan one step at a time. It was really fun to watch him play around with the person.Sexy Andrea Parker played Miss. Parker (an amusing coincidence that she herself said was one main reasons she took the role), who was filled with utter determination to capture Jarod and return him to the Centre, despite the times he helped save her own life and was someone she knew as a child growing up in the Centre. He even got her to start questioning the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of her mother, whose killer has remained a mystery through four seasons and two TV movies. Patrick Bauchau was Sydney, one of the few people Jarod ever felt that he could trust, and a father figure to him. Sydney often seemed happy for Jarod that he was free of the Centre and able to experience life, and their phone conversations (when Jarod would call for advice or just to talk) were always very nice. The good supporting cast included Richard Marcus (appropriately evil as the nefarious Mr. Raines), Jon Gries as scardy cat computer whiz Broots, Jamie Denton as Parker's brother, Harve Presnell as Parker's father (though that later became debatable following events in the first TV movie), and one-time James Bond himself George Lazenby as Jarod's father, who disappeared from the show as mysteriously as he had appeared.For three seasons, THE PRETENDER maintained a high quality of entertaining adventures and stories, with a good balance between the Jarod \"pretending\" stories and the Centre mythology sub-plots. But with the forth season, the show made the same mistake THE X-FILES made: it got too involved with itself. There was more and more focus on the internal conspiracies of the Centre instead of a focus on Jarod and his exploits. The show's mythology began to take over, and it seemed each week there was a new revelation about someone, like the writers couldn't make up their minds as to what they wanted to do. Thanks to this and a heavy dose of pre-emps, PRETENDER began to sag and was cancelled at the end of the season (just so NBC could carry XFL, and look how well that paid off).But thankfully, some loose ends were tied up by TNT, who picked up the show for reruns and gave us two movies. The first three seasons were the best, and I hope some day the show is made available on DVD.",

There were some very competent actors and actresses throughout the show.There's not really much scope for stories about lifeguards. How many stories can you have around lifeguards saving a person from drowning? Not many.

The human element is not lost like what happens in so many Zombie shows and movies. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love The Walking Dead but this show is just as good but in a different way.To let you know where I'm at, I have just finished watching the 5th episode. The show is building at a perfect pace and the character development is wonderful. If this was to really happen in a city in the U.S., this is how it would probably be handled, it has a very real feel to it. Some characters started off cowardly and scared and have developed into brave and helpful people while others have gone the other way. Some, like the lead police character have pretty much been the same person from the beginning. Lex is a genuine good cop who just happens to have the love of his life inside the danger zone or what the show calls the \"Cordon\". This is not a spoiler, you find out very quickly in the first episode how they get separated on either sides of the cordon. This is very painful to him but he does not let it interfere with his duty to the people of Atlanta.Don't buy into those silly reviews that are always race, creed or religion biased, those people will never be happy. This is not about the Syrians being evil or the black people being gang bangers or the white people being the goodies, there are all types of people inside the cordon and they are reacting very much like they would if this was real life, most are good, some are bad, enjoy the show.",

After watching about three episodes on TV, I decided to watch the movie and then after watching the movie of Nev's story, I marathoned all three seasons.Wow.I'm just blown away by some of these stories. I've never been catfished and I can't understand why anyone waste all this time and energy into being this different person?So after Catfish: The Movie explored Nev's story, he joins his brothers buddy Max, who was not in the film, to travel across America to help people in the same predicament as he was.Nev and Max make a good team; they would have to with all the together time these two would have filming this and Nev seems to be the hopeless romantic of the pair while Max is the realist.One thing that kind of annoyed me, they're always try to find some deeper meaning to the catfish. After dealing with the person who emailed them, they head off to talk to the catfisher and get their side. Most times there is a story but sometimes they try to dig to get one when sometimes, people are just assholes!As the show started airing and word starting getting around, I started to wonder about the truthfulness of the stories in the later season; how much of it was really people in need or people just looking for their 15 minutes of fame.I don't think you can have a 'relationship' with someone without having seen them, let alone one episode where a couple were 'engaged' without even meeting each other.And that takes me to my next point: Webcam not working? Bullshit! Most modern computers with webcams, most modern phones come with cameras and even if they don't, webcams are dirt cheap to buy.On the rare occasion, some of these people even brought gifts or sent money to the catfish! They were the moment where I just wanted to reach into the screen and shake these people.I did like how, even being a MTV show, they still accepted gay and lesbian catfishes.The soundtrack is pretty cool too with a mix of pop and alternative music, with the artist and track listed, in case you want to buy it.It is a good show, eye opening, but good.

    "critic_rating": "7.9", 
    "top_review": "After given the chance to review the pilot of Wilfred, I know exactly why the people at FX Networks chose to add it to its lineup. It's absolutely hilarious! From someone who is paid to do this, James Hibberd from Entertainment Weekly has called Wilfred the funniest pilot he's seen since Modern Family and I have to agree.FX being an innovative network has chosen for American audiences a brash Australian sitcom that stars the original actor, Jason Gann in the title role. Joining him is Elijah Wood as Ryan, a man so bent out of shape he feels there's no way out so he tries to commit suicide and he can't even do that right. Fiona Gubelmann plays Jenna, the new girl next door and Wilfred's owner. Dorian Brown who portrays Ryan's uptight sister, Kristen, completes the leading cast.Wilfred is set in a quaint community in Los Angeles California. The audience follows along through Ryan's disillusioned eyes as he tries to get a grip on reality. Trotting into a pivotal point in his life is a dog. Everyone else sees a cute, lovable pooch but Ryan sees a man in a dog costume.Both man and beast are leery but Wilfred settles in and Ryan has to get over his shock to accept the fact he has. Ryan walks, feeds and runs after Wilfred like any rambunctious pet. When others come into the scene, the audience and Ryan are jolted to the fact that Wilfred is not a man but a dog. It's in these instances that takes Ryan on a new level of hysteria and makes for humorous circumstances.On my first viewing of the pilot, my own dog was laying beside me and I laughed so loudly and so often, I scared the poor girl. It made me wonder what she may have said to me in those moments.Wilfred may not fit everyones tastes but for someone who isn't bothered in the least by profanity and yes, sometimes vulgar humor will enjoy Wilfred immensely. I believe this is because the crudeness is smoothed over by wit.The acting is sharp and cunning and in Wilfred's case, his bite is worse than his bark. Other than talking, drinking and getting high, Wilfred behaves like any dog. Not to be clich\u00e9 but Gann wears the dog suit perfectly. He's lovable and sweet though more times impetuous and you feel he needs the sting of a rolled up newspaper but he turns around and gives lessons and shares his wisdom that Ryan can take to heart.For those who have some reservations about Wood's comedic talents, you can put them to rest. It's not that he's setting out to be humorous, but is simply reacting to odd and perplexing situations and those lead to some hysterical moments. I'd put this in the category of \"funny man, straight man\" comedy and it's Elijah's strong ability to give emotions to his characters without saying much at all that makes him perfect for this bewildered individual.Gubelmann brings an air of lightheartedness to the show's gritty premise and sassy Brown's pretentious older sister will undoubtedly bring further mayhem with her intimidation. The timing during collective dialogs between the characters is amusing and a testament to the smart, creative and imaginative writing.The cinematography is ingenious that when Ryan drifts inside of himself, things around him diminish but only enough where he's still within the realm of his surroundings. The whimsical music and sound editing co-exists perfectly with the camera work which emphasizes the psychosis running amok in Ryan's mind. Wilfred not only tickled my funny bone but my senses as well.In the end, the question remains who's the man and who's the best friend? Perhaps at some point that will be known but until then, Wilfred should be entertaining and an adventure to find out",

    "top_review": "Over the past twenty years we have seen an absolute invasion of cop shows and crime dramas on the small screen. Some have been highly acclaimed, like \"NYPD Blue\", and others have been long running, like \"Law and Order\". But all those shows developed notoriety based on strong characters and overly developed drama, a combination that seemed to be a necessary formula for prime time. The end result was entertainment at the cost of realism and integrity, as show plots became as convoluted as the characters. Think \"The Shield\", except that show had a very narrow focus. Now there's \"Southland\", and after the first few episodes it becomes immediately apparent that it is a show that will not be well received because it is vastly different than what has appeared before. Simply put, it will not live up to mass market expectations of what should constitute a crime drama. This is unfortunate. \"Southland\" offers a different perspective. It is simplistic without sacrificing depth, an effect achieved by cutting out unnecessary interactions and plot developments. The scope of coverage is revolutionary as well, with the portrayal of several different divisions--patrol, homicide, organized crime. The characters are developed and highlighted by both their strengths and flaws, making their statements through the performance of their duty without becoming preachy or pathetic. They are not all perfect and selfless, but instead are presented as basically moral and slightly jaded. It is not a testament as a whole of the LAPD, therefore it does not require the presentation of issues that are unnecessary to the purpose of the show--racism, sexism, corruption. The continuity is beneficial, and unusual enough to be revolutionary. The acting is solid. The greatest surprise is Regina King, who appears as a socially struggling homicide detective, a drastic change from the often overbearing or domineering African-American female roles she has been stuck in. Her portrayal of a heartfelt but complex detective is spot on. C. Thomas Howell delivers an absurdly believable rendition of an alcoholic, barrel-driven patrolman. Michael Cudlitz and Ben McKenzie are the most intriguing, as they are the rookie/veteran partnership who have common integrity and incredibly different backgrounds, yet manage to work together without the clich\u00e9d buddy-buddy relationship. And the subject matter? Raw, gritty, realistic, without fanciful or violent action scenes. From the mundane, to the absurd, to the disturbing. The difficulties of police work are highlighted, and obstacles are not always overcome. It has been many years since a television show has delivered a straightforward, pulse-pounding episode, as evidenced by number seven, \"Derailed\". If you dislike crime dramas or cop shows, you obviously won't like Southland. For the rest, it will probably be a toss-up. Stop looking at what the show doesn't present, and focus instead on what it does offer, and you will discover how exceptional it is.",

Where else can you find a show nowadays where the female lead deals with feminist issues and doesn't allow herself to be sexually exploited or even to take issues of sex and commitment lightly without being naive or a prude? Looking back on it, there was more romantic comedy than mystery or drama in most of the shows, but the main characters were very appealing, as was their dilemma.

Yes the material is very similar to the original movie, but it's not trying to be something different. The masses won't watch the original movie because it's Australian and too heavy. Haters are gonna hate, but I would urge them to remember that very little material is original out there. Nowadays almost everything is an adaptation. This the perfect adaptation for the mass market who simply don't want to sit through one heavy, dark as hell feature, they want a recurring show, they want to get to know the characters. If this does its job properly it will have viewers turning to the feature film in between the first and second season... As you can tell I loved this adaptation as much as i loved the original feature, almost more because it was fun. I want fun. I want well executed television and I felt that I was given just that.I advise you try it out for yourself. You're either gonna switch off or turn back on so what's the worst that can happen!?",

    "critic_rating": "8.2", 
    "top_review": "This is the first, and in my opinion, the best of the Blackadder series - although the second installment runs a very close second. This series, in retrospect, is often dismissed as less funny than its successors and this may be due to its different style and sense of humour. This comparison  unfortunately causes the viewer to miss what makes this series such an excellent piece of comedy writing and production.The whole series centres on Edmund (Rowan Atkinson), the son of the younger of the two princes who in history were murdered in the Tower of London, allegedly by Richard III. In this take on history, where real history is dismissed as being rewritten by Henry Tudor, the princes were not murdered and Richard Duke of York grows up 'to be a strong boy'. The first episode of the series lays the foundation, explaining how Richard III dies, how Edmund's father becomes King and also the important, accidental, foretelling by three Witches (a clever alude to the witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth) to Edmund that one day he will be King. The rest of the series follows Edmund in his attempts to realise this foretelling.Edmund's definite goal throughout the series, which forms the basis of the subsequent plotlines, gives it a direction perhaps missing in the following series, and it also gives his character more depth. Blackadder (as he names himself), in this series, is significantly different to his persona of the subsequent time-periods - being slimy, selfish and not particularly bright. There is a definite bond between the main characters, Blackadder and his sidekicks, Percy and Baldrick (excellently played by Tim McInnerny and Tony Robinson respectively) and although Blackadder treats his underlings with contempt at times, they collaborate as a team throughout in a series of 'cunning plans'. Baldrick is indeed the intelligent character of the group, the man in the know and his character has much more depth than his smelly and stupid character of later series.Each plot in the series follows a similar pattern - Blackadder getting himself into a situation and having to get himself out of it. The humour presented is more subtle, relying more on the use of visual comedy, language and historical satire than on blind sarcasm. Many of the gags are implied and expect the viewer to work out the meaning as opposed to ramming it down their throats. Additionally, the script contains a number of lines that cleverly misuse Shakespeare for added effect, a classic example being Richard III calling for 'my horse, my horse my kingdom for a horse' in the style of someone calling for his dog. The supporting cast all play their part superbly, particularly Brian Blessed as Richard IV, the maniacal war-monger who hates his slimy son and fails to get his name right. The late, great Peter Cook also makes an appearance as Richard III in the first episode.This series must be watched out of context with what followed. It was not written for the popular market, being first screened on BBC2. Watch it, laugh, then watch it again to catch some of the gags you missed the first time. Comedy written this well is unfortunately extremely rare, and to dismiss it without appreciating its aims does not do it justice. This series not only shows Rowan Atkinson at his very best, but also the writing of Richard Curtis (and Atkinson) and it is an overlooked classic of British comedy.",

    "top_review": "You know I was pondering the other day, my friends and I are children of the 90's and were going through all the awesome things we got to experience including some fun TV shows. I brought up that there is something missing from this generation, it seems as if most cartoons or kid's shows today are just lame. I was wondering if I was just saying this because I grew up, but everyone agreed and said there is one show that's proof of that: Animaniacs. We started watching the show again and the interesting thing is, as kids this show was non stop in the laughs department, now as grown ups, it seems like it actually got better. We never realized how much this show was not just meant for the kids as well as the adults as well. Animaniacs is a show that pushed the limits, had great pop culture humor, was great in animation and had the most memorable side characters.Yakko, Wakko and Dot are three God-knows-what that were created for a new cartoon, but when they brought chaos and anarchy to the Warner Brothers Studio. Their films also seemed to make no sense, so they were locked away in the Warner Brothers tower to never be released, but every day they do what they can to escape and have adventures. They have a psychiatrist named Dr. Scratchensniff who is trying to figure out what they are and how they think. They are also constantly chased by the security guard who is trying to protect the head of the Warner Brothers studio from the three crazy little... things.We also have several side characters, starting with Pinky and the Brain. Two lab mice, Brain does the same thing every night as he tries to take over the world with his insane goofy side kick Pinky, who's head isn't screwed on tightly enough. Mindy and Buttons, Mindy is a child who constantly always manages to escape her house and get into a mega amount of trouble while her poor dog Buttons is behind taking all the hits to protect her. Chicken Boo, a giant chicken of many clever disguises. Katie Kaboom, a hormone crazy teenager who looses her temper just a bit too easy and always turns into a giant monster. Rita and Runt, a stranded cat and dog, Rita sings and Runt thinks she's a cool dog. Slappy Squirrel and her nephew Skippy, she's an old cartoon star who's a bit cranky with the way cartoons are made now-a-days. Flavio and Marita, two high class hippo's enjoying the city life. Menerva Mink, quite the looker, who is looking for her true love. Mr. Skullhead who always takes the most random hits for Yakko, Wakko and Dot. And of course, The Goodfeathers, based off of Goodfellas, three pigeons who are trying to be \"coo\" with the city and claim their territory of Statue Scorcesse.Animaniacs is such a classic cartoon, it broke my heart that this show was somehow canceled, I don't know why it was. It brought great laughs and a fun spin off with Pinky and the Brain. There are extremely clever jokes, to pick a favorite skit to someone to ask you if you'd rather be in love or have millions of dollars, it's just too hard to pick. Yeah, I'm a crappy romantic, I know. But Animaniacs is a show that I sincerely miss, if you ever get the chance to see it, please take it! It's so funny to see all the jokes that you laughed as a kid then grow up to get the real meaning behind it.",

While most TV pilots seem hackneyed and forced, this had the quality of a feature film. Pilots are out there to bait the audience and this one did so with a pace that, if they can keep it up, will have the viewer exhausted by the end of every hour. My surprise turned to sheer joy by the end of this first episode. Both Izzard and Driver are amazing in their respective roles, flowing effortlessly through their very complex characters. The writing is intense and raw and the dialogue is both natural and on point. I had no idea what I was getting into when the show opened and the thread of the drama pulled me right through to the end. I'm not one to watch many TV shows on a weekly basis but for this show, I'll make the time. Definitely the best TV I've seen in years.",

    "top_review": "I have only seen the first two installments of this series and but was impressed enough to leave a review. Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead. I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity. Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters. There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture. Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us.",

A good drama should make us think, should move us, inspire us, stretch our minds, and enable us to identify with the ups and downs of the lives of its characters. However, with EastEnders no intellectual effort is required at all when watching each unfolding episode, because the plots are so laboriously developed, and the dialogue and acting so predictable and patronising to the viewer. Far from being uplifting and inspiring, the storylines are so dire and constantly negative as to leave the viewer feeling thoroughly depressed. In the name of \"realism\" the stories are in fact unreal and sensational, and not reflective of real life at all. Just as British viewers would, quite wrongly, assume Australians to be shallow and superficial if we were to believe the way they are portrayed in Australian soaps, then surely Australians and Americans must think that life in Britain is pretty dire and depressing, if they believe that EastEnders is representative of the lifestyle of the average working class Briton. When will British viewers remove the blinkers and see this programme for what it is - cheap, sensational, ratings-driven, self-indulgent and catering to the lowest common denominator and basest instincts of its mass audience. Have we no imaginative, innovative and ground-breaking screenwriters left in Britain, and where are the new generation of great British actors to come from? Not, I believe, from the ranks of Britains \"best\" soap.",

    "top_review": "I don't usually write reviews for shows, nor have I ever written about anything on IMDb before, but I felt as if I should after watching this show.It's hard to put into words the way I felt about watching BoJack Horseman. Sure, it starts out as a comedy with seemingly no real plot. Sometimes it just seems stupid, yet still comes off as possibly a new, interesting yet also run-of-the-mill animated series, but it starts to develop into something more. Something that I think a lot of people may or may not fully see to the end of the first season because they decided the show wasn't for them. And that might still be true. But I can't help but feel some form of disappointment. Why? I don't really know. I guess I just foolishly want everyone to get something out of it.I don't think anything, whether it's a book, a movie, a game, or even a show deserves a 10. But sometimes, for just a brief instant, you stop caring about how you want to quantify how much you like something and just want to express how much you enjoyed it. That to me is the only way I can really describe BoJack Horseman. I can't say it's good, or bad, or even average. It's just a show that wants to get its point across, whether it's original or not. And it does it in a way that's hard to look at critically.And at the risk of sounding like I'm contradicting everything I've already tried to say, I almost don't want the show to have a new season. Not because I hate it or think it's \"too good\" to continue on, but because it already feels complete. I obviously don't feel bad that the series has already been renewed for a second season. And even if it happened to only be a two season series, I'd still be thrilled. It's just that in some way, I hope it doesn't change.So even though most likely no one will be reading this review (which is actually more like a reflection of how I felt about the show rather than a genuine examination), I at least hope that more people will try watching it and get some enjoyment out of it. Even if it's only for one episode. Who knows? I might even look back at it and wonder what I was thinking, or why I wrote a frankly pointless review about it.But that's alright.

They know how silly they must sound at times.  Remember the episode where Dawson had his birthday and Andee and him got drunk and he just leveled into everybody?  Do you remember what he said to Joey?  \" Joey, the only fifteen year old I know that needs to find herself. \"To say these teens are precocious is to say that Star Wars has a large following.  It's just not needed.  We all know that, but what makes the show so good is the characters, the writing, the setting, the direction, the production values, oh hell, everything makes this show good.  It really is one of a kind.What I like best about it is that Dawson is a dreamer.  He does not want to grow up to be \" Joe \" down the street.  He wants to be Spielberg.   And sometimes he takes flak for who he is.  But how many of us have dreamed? How many of us have taken flak for it?  So how many of us can relate to this in one way or another?I do agree however with the general census that Joshua Jackson is the best part of the show.  Pacey is down to earth and he is not as wordy as the other characters.  But his relationship with Andee is so complex and so refreshing that you yearn for his screen time, you get anxious to see what he is going to do next, and I do think he has the greatest range on the show.  In the final episode of the second year, when he finally made some sort of amends with his dad..... powerful stuff.I do like Joey and I think Katie Holmes is a wonderful actor, as is Van Der Beek and Williams. All in all this show is a refreshing taste of what it was like to be a teen and I applaud them for having the guts to tackle such delicate subjects as homosexuality and the difficulty in believing in God. That takes guts and they handle it with integrity and class.There isn't a better show on TV and I look forward to every Friday ( here in Ontario ) to see what is going to happen next.

There is no doubt about it that this show is one to keep an eye on, it seems it gets darker each episode, but with that said that could also end up killing the show as a lot of viewers have accepted its violence so far because it has been done tastefully, without too much gore. Most of the bloodier scenes take place in a dark place or is carefully done by camera angles to get the point across but to not upset the CW's typical viewers, and this is great in a world of The Walking Death and Game of Thrones, etc. It's a welcome method of delivering the same intensity without being overly grotesque. There are too many negative comments on this website regarding this show, it's getting good! I expect to see this series renewed soon.",

The only known survivors are the residents of twelve space stations in Earth's orbit prior to the war.

Resources are scarce and all crimes no matter their nature or severity are punishable by death (\"floating\") unless the perpetrator is under 18 years of age. After the Ark's life support systems are found to be critically failing, one hundred juvenile prisoners are declared \"expendable\" and sent to the surface in a last ditch attempt to determine if Earth is habitable again.

Six Feet Under is simply in my opinion, the best hour on television, and one of the best shows ever. Of all time. Brilliantly written, brilliantly told, brilliantly acted, brilliantly brilliant. I've never used brilliant so much in a review before.  First off, it's a show about a very real family, with very real issues to deal with. The family, who have just recently lost the father consists of the mother Ruth, two sons Nate and David, and sister Claire. The two brothers run the business prviously owned by the father, a funeral parlor. I just love this show. There is not a single bad actor on the show, in every role. The family is probably one of the most real ever portrayed on TV, the characters being all easily relatable to, I myself can relate to two of them in particular. It's fresh, at times funny, at times sad, at times everything. Every single actor is amazing in their roles from Brenda to David to Keith to Ruth to Frederico to everybody. And the story lines are just so brilliant, dealing with life and it's purpose, seen throught the eyes of these people who work with death in a funeral home. It's just amazing. I could rave on and on for hours about how great this show is and how much I love it, but I have to stop sometime. If you haven't yet watched Six Feet Under please do yourself a favor and do. I love it and it's one of my all time favorite shows. Simply, yes, you guessed it, brilliant.",

With bleak prospects waiting for them back home, and noting the attentive looks they get from men in a local bar, they decide to stay a while. The Bertinelli character rents a house, where the caretaker is Elke (Betty White).So far, this is a very funny show, with marvelous performances. With Malick and Frasier's Daphne starring, that's to be expected. White is amazing - 88 and still going strong and still a master of timing. The weak sister for me is Bertinelli, whose comedy seems forced.As a baby boomer myself, I like seeing shows relating to my age group featuring older actresses, who, like the Malick character, really do find the going rough in Hollywood, particularly if they're too attractive for character roles. And it is true, particularly in a youth-oriented town like L.A., older women are pretty much invisible to men their own age. It's probably true anywhere, but particularly there.I'm really enjoying it, and I hope it's picked up for more episodes.",

For all the obvious similarities between the two shows with their period-piece settings and respective portrayals of entrenched misogyny, this BBC/Kudos production marches resolutely to the beat of its own drum. \"The Hour\" is gritty and gray. It's temperature is cold. One of its main themes is the examination of conflict in a variety of forms; the deep internal conflict between ardent idealism and soul-numbing compromise or between personal integrity and ruthless ambition; and the dogged pursuit of truth in the face of suppression and censorship. Other classic struggles between opposing dynamics are also explored. These include individualism and conservatism, inspiration and convention, impoverishment and privilege, courage and fear, rational caution and paranoia, democracy and tyranny etc - all of which are set amid the historic backdrop of two salient international military conflicts. The landscape is panoramic and the brush-strokes reach far and wide but the painting remains clearly defined. All the elements are tautly packed into a 360 minute thought-provoking thriller. If comparisons must be drawn, then \"Goodnight and Good Luck\" might prove to be a helpful suggestion. With its subtle script, insightful direction, solid casting and a stunning performance from Ben Whishaw, \"The Hour\" is one of the BBC's finest. Congratulations to all involved with this production.

It pulls the viewer in, and there's enough original material that many times you can't \"skip ahead\" to the fourth act in your mind. Meaning, you haven't figured out the end by the second break.MI-5, or Spooks, puts enough plot twists in for any true fan of the genre. Well worth the time and effort to watch. Too bad American network television can't produce a show of this caliber.(11/17/05 comment) Also, I was so intrigued by the UK version of Spooks, that I got into downloading the shows via the Internet, and I have to say it's an even better experience. I wish A&E would run the entire episode and not a chopped up version. The editing has to do with advert breaks more than content. If you only see this on A&E then I would suggest downloading it or renting/buying the DVD sets.",

There are so many little moments that strike a chord with me... The awkward silence after cracking a terrible joke. The exalting victory of the person you like finally texting you back. The struggle of navigating parties where you don't know anyone.Some people might not like this show because of that rawness, but I for one find it endearing. I love seeing Mickey and Gus' story play out in such an unconventional way. You really do feel sympathy for the characters' successes and failures. Give it a try, because you might find a little bit of yourself in this show.",

I love the feeling of magic it gave me, and the interesting characters and setting. So of course I was worried about Dragons, considering the show for Kung Fu Panda was disappointing. I expected the same amount of great character development and heart touching story lines from Kung Fu Panda Legends of Awesome, but didn't get those. I was expecting Dragons to suffer the same fate, and I was wrong. Right away, I notice that the animation quality is just better than other Dreamworks animated shows. then there's the plot. No little 15 minute stories here, instead we get 30 minute plots that show a problem, involve character development followed by the solution to the problem. Most of the voice actors have returns and the music sounds incredibly, so the sound quality of the show is amazing. The writing is pretty much on par with the movie as well, and the jokes are funny and witty. Its a truly great show that CN should be glad that they picked up.",

I have watched the original of this series and liked it a lot. So I was interested to see how the show was recast for an American audience. So far, the plot is very true to the original and as close as it can given the change in countries. And it is at least as good as the original as far as the first show is concerned.What I liked about this show is the interesting twist of the two partners who are effectively forced to team up with each other. For me, the Americanization of the plot line was a positive and I thought was very well done.Try this show and I think you will like it if you like solid police procedurals with an interesting twist in the personalities of the main characters.Edit: After watching the first 5 episodes of this sleeper show of the season, I believe this version tops the original. It grabbed my attention from the beginning and its interweaving of the US border problems, drug dealing and wild west type newspaper headlines is very well done. Watch it and enjoy.One last thought. The original was topical to Sweden and Denmark so I am amazed how naysayers who saw the original either never spotted the topical nature of the show or seem to be saying that the Sweden/Denmark cultural aspect of the original show should have been duplicated in a U.S. show! Most U.S. viewers would not know what to make of seeing Sweden/Denmark cultural clashes or even know of those clashes! What are these naysayers thinking??",

The Hulk performed physical feats in the comic that would have been impossible to duplicate when this series was running, and comic books are so simplistic and often violent, they never would have allowed it on prime time TV.That said, the Incredible Hulk was a good TV show with strong acting by Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno that was, mostly, harmless fun for the whole family. The Hulk represented a kind of \"Elephant Man\" character, who certainly looks scary, but is genuinely kind and gentle and wants to help people in trouble (sort of a one man A-Team). I don't remember him ever seriously hurting anyone, and most of the physical parts involved him bending gun barrels so they couldn't be fired or turning cars over on their roofs. With the kind of strength the Hulk had, he could have torn people in half, but he settled for bending steel piping around them and leaving them helpless for the police to take to jail. He was gentle with animals and young people as well as old.The story is a very sad one: Bixby, playing scientist David Banner, is stuck in a life on the run from an obsessed reporter who wants to become famous by photographing the Hulk. Banner and the Hulk represent the ultimate misunderstood hero/antihero: someone who is a better person than most of us are, yet is persecuted because of other people's misunderstandings.Harmless fun for the whole family, and some good lessons for youngsters about kindness and not judging others for their appearance.",

    "critic_rating": "9.0", 
    "top_review": "I firmly believe that one of the major aspects of what makes House of Cards so good is the ability to watch all the episodes back-to-back with no commercials or programming schedules to get in the way. This small but hugely significant idea will be an industry game changer and I am certain that this is just the beginningTo me, the biggest advantage that this idea contributes to House of Cards is that it frees up significant time during episodes because it makes things like flashbacks or repeats of events almost completely redundant. There's simply no need for them because everything is so fresh in your mind, which leaves all that extra time for more story, more action, more conspiracy, more drama, more of the stuff that viewers really want to see. However it must be said that it does take a few episodes to get used to this, and you have to be really switched on and completely focused to ensure you don't miss a beat, because you really will pay a price if you do because what's said is never repeated, only referenced further down the trackAs for the show itself, I can't sum it up any better than by saying it's incredibly good to watch. The one aspect of the show I enjoy the most is the monologue, or removal of the fourth wall, between the viewer and Underwood. It's an incredibly effective method of storytelling as well as the expression of emotion or opinion, and Kevin Spacey does a superb job at pulling it off, along with every other aspect of his complex and intriguing character.The quality of writing, directing, and storytelling is as good as you'll ever see on the best shows in the world right now. Underwood has a massive ship to steer, and it is fascinating watching how he does it, through manipulation, blackmail, greed and determination. Each and every character has a critical role to play - there's no characters you could cast aside as being irrelevant or unnecessary to the story. That is a very difficult feat to achieve, and House of Cards easily passes that testIf you're going to pioneer something, like Netflix have with how viewers can watch House of Cards, you have to do it well. Everything has to be perfect, otherwise it will flop. A top quality show in House of Cards coupled with the worlds best internet streaming service is a very very good place to start. Netflix and the House of Cards team deserve a huge round of applause for daring to go places where no one has gone before. The $100 million gamble has definitely paid off, and I cannot wait for moreNeedless to say, House of Cards earns a 10/10 rating, and an absolute must-watch from me",

They are showing the truth. And showing that there still is humor in life. Most sit-coms now-a-days shy too much away from reality and give us a syrupy-sweet, trite twenty minutes of simulated laugh tracks and simulated humor.

I think it's got something for everyone. I just don't understand why people judge so quickly and bring down the show. It really was getting better and better. It needed to create momentum. And when it was getting more addictive, someone decided to cancel. Come on producers, give it a chance again! You have no idea how that show is so liked in other countries.I hope one day, somebody retake it again and bring it up to the next level.

    "top_review": "UPDATE: I've watched three episodes now and my reaction is exactly the same as it was after watching the premiere, great show.Also, for people worried about IMDb listing only 6 episodes in the show, worry not! Hannah Kasulka (the excellent actress who plays Casey Rance in the show) has told me that they are filming ten episodes for the first season! :DOriginal review follows: OK, so let me start off by saying I'm a huge The Exorcist (1973) fan, and think that it is the best horror movie ever made. Similarly, I also liked The Conjuring 1 and 2, Insidious 1 and 2, The Ring, The Babadook, and The Thing (1982). Talking about TV shows that are usually categorized as horror, I also enjoy The Walking Dead. American Horror Story is meh-ish but Season 1-2 were pretty good. Lastly, Supernatural isn't exactly horror nowadays, but I still enjoy watching it.I think it's important that you know about my taste in horror, so you can judge and weigh my review. I started watching this episode with a skeptical mind, knowing how this reboot of a TV series of my favorite horror movie could go horribly wrong, likely many other remakes and reboots out there.So, the episode started off as you might have expected, hints of horror and tension, but nothing really to make you jump out of your seat. However, after around 10-15 minutes, it started to become really interesting. There were scenes of genuine suspense, and no, I'm not talking about strange noises (which are pretty standard in all horror movies), but actually a few attempts at exorcism.This is where the show really started to shine for me, the special effects used were decent, though I would appreciate a little less close-ups to the face and shaking cameras in future episodes. But generally, it was overall pretty good and reminded me a lot of the movie and the book (yes, I've read it) it's based on. I also liked the references sneaked in (especially the one in the article, and right at the end).Acting was spot-on. I have seen Ben Daniels in House of Cards, and Geena Davis in Stuart Little, but the rest of the cast were generally unknown to me. That said, all of them really surprised me with excellent acting, especially Alfonso Herrera, Hannah Kasulka, and Brianne Howie. These characters actually felt relate-able and not the usual nincompoops we see in horror movies. I liked how the characters immediately consulted specialists instead of dragging the thing out for two or three episodes.As this is a spoiler-free review, I'm not going to go into the details, but if I had to rate the following out of 10, this is how I would do it:Story: 9 ||||| Cast / Acting: 9.5 ||||| Dialog: 8.5 ||||| Horror: 8.5 ||||| Direction / Effects etc: 8.5 ||||| Originality: 9.5The only thing I found slightly lacking was the amount of horror in it. Sure, there were legit scenes of terror, but I'd really like to see the show go beyond and scare the hell out of me like The Exorcist did. (I couldn't sleep the entire night after I watched that movie almost four years ago, when I was 16).All in all, if you're bored of the current \"horror\" shows which are kind of failing at horror *cough* AHS *cough* Supernatural *cough*, this is looking like the show to go to. That said, this is just my reaction after watching one episode, and I could be wrong. However, the preview for the next episode looked really awesome and I really think that this show is going to be great, must watch! ;)P.S: Also, watch out for that twist at the end of the episode, pretty great! ;)",

I actually read one comment that stated \"Give Seth Macfarlane another show!\" God forbid! I was a huge fan of Futurama, About the first 10 seasons of the Simpsons, Clone High, Mission Hill, Undergrads, About the first four seasons of Family Guy... so on and so forth. This is the first show that has made me really laugh in a long time. It's clever, and the humor is a bit dryer and more subtle. There are some pretty crude stuff I suppose...I dunno. I seriously think that people have forgotten what it's like to watch something that isn't preachy, in-your-face, and blatant.At least this show incorporates its jokes into the story and episode arch... as opposed to Family Guy's idiotic asides...",

The protagonist, Otonashi, lost his memories after his death. Nevertheless he joins a mysterious group, which is fighting \"Tenshi\" (Angel).The characters are all really likable and you can remember them easily.What really stands out are the songs played by the band \"Girls Dead Monster\". For me, the songs were just awesome, but that obviously depends on the music you like.I have to admit that the story develops a bit slow at the beginning. The first 4 or 5 five episodes i only watched 1 episode at a time, but then i couldn't stop. The end was one of the most touching i ever saw. During the last episode i cried more than once.Some scenes, also one in the final episode, feel forced and killed the atmosphere, but otherwise it was a pretty touching anime. Due to the fact, that all of the characters already died, it makes you think about your life and what YOU want to achieve in your life.It is not perfect, rather slow paced at the beginning and i watched it with no expectations at all. But it also is very touching (at least for me), has an interesting topic and likable characters. I give it 8 out of 10 and can easily recommend this anime. If you can forgive some minor flaws and a slow paced beginning, you will probably enjoy \"Angel Beats!\". Of course there are better animes out there, but there are also tons of worse ones.",

But when I actually watched part of the first or second episode, I was surprised to find myself starting to get drawn in. Here's what I like about this show: First, the kids talk like kids (even if some of them look like adults!). I don't know about anyone else, but after Dawson's Creek and The Gilmore Girls, I find it refreshing to see a show about teenagers who have trouble expressing themselves instead of speaking in pithy, self-aware sound bites. Second, this show does a believeable job of presenting the class issues involved in having a \"poor kid\" move in with a \"rich family\". Others have pointed out that it avoided the initial cliche by having the two teenage boys become friends, but later episodes have shown that in spite of their friendship and common interests (e.g. comic books), there are still deeper issues of class and sexuality that show how different their \"worlds\" really are. And finally, I was surprised to see that the writers were actually able to make me care about the problems of the rich characters! (The adults, anyway). For too many nighttime soap operas, portraying the \"problems of the rich\" are just a way to get us \"unwashed\" types to sneer at the \"problems\" that money brings (\"I wish I had those problems!\"). In \"The O.C.\", the writers actually explore questions of money, class (again) and love in the various adult couples in a way that brings Jane Austen to mind; we can relate to the struggles the characters are going through even if their day-to-day lives are completely foreign from our own. All in all, a surprisingly enjoyable TV soap opera that doesn't require you to check your entire brain at the door.",

I was teased endlessly in high school for being a Chuck Norris fan, but this series made it all worth it. I got my weekly dose of uncynical, clean-languaged action and got to laugh at the sometimes too-good-to-be-true situations. It was nice to have a show out there that didn't feel like it had to use foul language and sexual innuendos every ten seconds to appeal to their audience. I love Chuck Norris' multi-cultural character and the way he mixes Native American wisdom with kick-butt martial arts. Clarence Gilyard's character, James Trivette, was perfectly cast. No one I have talked to could imagine anyone but Clarence Gilyard playing Trivette. He was good in Matlock, but he was sensational in Walker, Texas Ranger. Noble Willingham made for a perfect CD Parker--in fact, he reminded me more than once of my Uncle Jimmy. Sheree J Wilson could not have been cast more perfectly as Assistant DA Alex Cahill, Walker's courtroom nemesis at first, then later his love interest. My favorites, though, have to be the later addition of Judson Mills as Francis Gage and Nia Peeples as Sydney Cooke. Could there have been any more romantic tension between those two?!?!? Judson Mills added a certain almost school-boy charm when it came to bantering with Sydney and Nia Peeples was perfect in the way she let Gage know he was utterly clueless when it came to women. My dad used to say \"You know, you can only take so many boots to the face before you just don't get up anymore and I think Walker has exceeded his limit.\" I was sad to see this show end, but I'm glad that USA Network and the Hallmark Channel air reruns of it, even though they are mostly older episodes from the early '90's.",

It's hard to avoid this show, even if you're an adult, or a teen. This show also cheers you up very easily. You may like it, or you may not believe that you're watching something like this, but either way, it will somehow get to you.The story lines are focused around SpongeBob, an energetic sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea. Each episode focuses around him and his misadventures with other people in his town known as Bikini Bottom. His best friend is the dopey starfish Patrick, his other best friend is the land squirrel who lives in a submarine home, Sandy. Other characters in the show are SpongeBob's drowsy neighbor, Squidward, his boss at work, Mr. Krabs, the evil Plankton, and the driving school teacher Mrs. Puff. There are a bunch of other characters in the show, but most episodes are focused around them. These days, Nickelodeon hasn't been doing so well. Most of their new shows are spin offs of old shows, and most of the new shows aren't good at all. SpongeBob is very reminiscent of older Nickelodeon shows. Elements like quirky humor, annoying neighbors, fun plot lines, slightly dark humor in a few episodes(not as much as the old Nickelodeon shows), mishaps at work, worst enemies, and mishaps due to SpongeBob's antics all make this show great. There are times when this show can become stupid, as a matter of fact, every episode uses stupidity in a certain way. Some episodes are smartly written, and in odd ways, certain episodes have a message in them. There is nothing in this show that should make parents feel uncomfortable. In most episodes, there is some type of adult humor that adults and teens will find to be funny. Everyone should see this show.

However, he occasionally reveals his concern about the dangers of their crime fighting, his feelings of loneliness and burden about being a single parent, and even buried anger from his childhood.The girls have distinct personalities as well: Blossom, the self-appointed leader, is very smart for her age and has an ego to match; Buttercup is a tomboy who cannot wait until she is old enough to go out after dark; and Bubbles behaves like a normal five-year-old girl, coloring, singing, and trying to keep the peace.  Our adorable heroines experience the friction that most siblings do, but their love and fight against evil keep them together.Also, the supporting characters, including both the good citizens and the villains, have complex yet consistent personalities.  The kind mayor's assistant and evil Mojo Jojo are as interesting and complex the Powerpuff Girls themselves.  Even if a scene begins with a random monster attacking the city, you can be sure that there is more to the story, and another piece of the relationship puzzle will be put in its place before the show is over.Of course, the episodes are extremely funny and uplifting, and the only thing this show does not have is the built-in toy advertising.  The writers and artists borrow elements from shows and movies that we children of the sixties enjoyed.  Besides their own original story lines, they have cleverly parodied \"Star Wars,\" the classic step-mom fairy tales, and everything from James Bond to Japanese monster films.  Whether the subject is exciting, sad, or scary, you will always find the humor and the warmth.The show does have a few minor drawbacks: sometimes the \"cartoon violence\" is a bit excessive, and I recommend that young children do not watch this show - it is rated for children eight-years-old and older.  There are sometimes inconsistencies between shows or even in the same episode, but these are minor, and I should not complain because it is a cartoon after all.Overall, \"The Powerpuff Girls\" is an excellent television show that leaves its audience feeling good.  All of the characters are well developed, and the girls themselves are as believable as kindergarten superheroines can be. With their love, willingness to fight for good, and ability to take action instead of whining, Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup are truly the role models for the twenty-first century.",

This sparsely populated village that fits neatly under an invisible dome has Caucasians, African Americans, Asians, Latinos, Native Americans, and mixed race lesbian couples! The only group that seems to be missing is single Sri Lankan gay men.Everyone seems to co-exist just fine, even though it's not clear if anyone in the town actually has a job, except for Beth Broderick, the local diner waitress who pours coffee all day, Natalie Martinez, the most incompetent cop ever to make it onto the force, and the dreadful Rachelle Lefevre as the local hard-as-nails journalist who spends most of her time skulking around through open fields and taking pictures of air. No wonder she lost her big city newspaper job and ended up under this plexiglass shield.Once that darned dome comes down, Chester's Mill becomes a modern day Peyton Place and everyone's deep, dark secrets begin to surface. The problem here, though, is that none of the characters is compelling or sympathetic. We just wanna find out what's up with that dome, but instead, we're forced to watch these poorly conceptualized folks interact with each other with eye-rolling dialogue like, \"So they say you're passin' through town. What are you runnin' from?\" Every now and then, someone mentions they're worried the dome may collapse onto Chester's Mill. Frankly, my fingers are crossed that's exactly what will happen. No town this boring should be allowed to stay on the map.Dome = 1 Chester's Mill = 0",

    "top_review": "If you happen to view any of the other \"reviews\" here you'll find that many have given abysmal ratings for the show because of trivial reasoning; many because they're still rather perturbed over the status of the Expanded Universe, others seem like attempts at trolling, and many are spiteful simply because they don't agree with the concept of the show and cannot accept that the Expanded Universe isn't coming back. One even seems to have gone the full-on melodramatic route and declared Star Wars to be dead and that they won't be showing their younger siblings Star Wars at all due to this horrible tragedy.Should you view the individual ratings given to the show you'll find that the general opinion is favorable with votes generally increasing the higher up the ratings you go, save for a rather blatantly obvious discrepancy. The ratio of \"1/10\" reviews compared to the others has been grossly blown out of proportion by people whose anger seems to have overcome them.The characters are perfectly fine, the animation could have been better I will admit, and the pacing for the premiere was quick and could have taken more time to breath but when all has been said and done the show has learned from the mistakes made during the early seasons of The Clone Wars and has applied those lessons much the same as the latter seasons did.People talking about how the designs or appearances of things are off haven't been paying attention to the development of the show, as the creators have on numerous occasions cited the reasoning behind the changes and additions. The Imperial's equipment has taken a design cue from Kenner's classic line of toys adored by children who grew up on Star Wars, fans, and collectors alike. The show takes places five years before \"Star Wars\" and as such they wanted everything to feel extremely familiar while being off just enough to give the feel of this being a different time period. The TIE Fighters have shorter wings, the stormtrooper's helmets are more bulbous and their blasters have a small hump along the spine, and the REX droids from Star Tours serve as pilots on spacecraft. The camera remains static and far less dynamic to mimic the movement of the original movies while even switching to mimic 70mm film during space sequences. The lightsabers flicker and are flatter, green light cracks whenever two blades meet, and pulling out a lightsaber feels special again. Every single detail has been carefully considered and crafted to capture the feel of the Original Trilogy Era and movies.It's Firefly meets Star Wars with a ragtag crew running around the edge of civilized space trying to get by and hitting the Empire whenever the chance is presented. It's classic Star Wars and exactly the kind of thing you'd like should you be a fan of Star Wars at all.",

So now for my direct opinions. Wolf's Rain is one of the best things I have ever seen. After every episode I found myself searching for a paradise of my own and a purpose as great as the wolves'. It is an addicting series that is beautifully done--the artwork is amazing and the animation has virtually no flaws. It flows and flows, and leaves you stunned at the end. A good stunned though. An inspired stunned. Which leaves me to my last note--if you're looking for an anime where you can predict the ending, this one ain't it.

Indeed, when watching the series I actually forget I'm watching sci-fi.Watch it if you can, I suspect you'll like it.",

This is a completely new take on a long running series from the 1980s with the necessary level of added grit needed in 2013. Whilst employing many of the well known character names; the \"new\" version has created juicy variations to the originals. Those familiar with the original series should not allow themselves to by put off in the early stages by casting of different types to play the original characters. Ep 1 was edgy, well paced and the acting overall was very good. If Wentworth can maintain the same intensity over its remaining 9 episodes of season 1, it will be a treat to watch. As well as seeing how the initial variation to different main characters develop, perhaps growing into their more familiar traits from the original series as the new series progresses. Clearly this re-make is attempting to tell the background story as to how the likes of Bea Smith, Vera Bennett, Meg Jackson and Frankie Doyle came to be like they were in the original Prisoner series.",

Based on the blog and subsequent novel by the mysterious Belle de Jour, this is an insight into the life of a high-end call girl who turns normal prostitute stereotypes on their head. Annoyingly, the production has a slightly soft focus sheen which gives it a somewhat abstract (and low budget) feel. Visualise an '80s pop promo and you'll know what I mean!It's only a matter of minutes before the first episode kicks into gear with Piper delivering energetic, simulated fellatio on a gawping customer. For British television, this is no-holds-barred stuff with \"F\" and \"C\" words, and relatively graphic imagery at every turn. I was pleasantly surprised at the bravery of this drama - it doesn't disappoint but despite the sexual gymnastics on display, the series lacks any real erotic content. It has the substance of a late-night MTV video.Piper herself delivers a great performance. She's as likable as always as both Hannah and her late-night alter ego and she makes the most of the relatively light material contained within the script.The beautiful Cherie Lunghi plays Piper's agent, Stephanie, a no-nonsense, straight-talking businesswoman. Marvellous stuff.8 out of 10. With this series, Piper has shrugged off the shadow of \"Doctor Who\"'s Rose and entered a whole new territory. Without a doubt, she's an actress that will continue to enjoy success in the fields of television and cinema.",

That makes it a lot of fun, and a very exciting show, but at times it also makes it hard for me to warm up to the cast, and hard to just take a moment of contemplation, peace, and relaxation like I would with The Last Airbender.Visually, like \"Aang\", this show is stunning. Beautiful, intricate and unique environments, with lots of fluid and well-crafted motion. Awesome soundtrack with the series' trademark mix of eastern and western music, but \"Korra's\" music is more rocky and jazzy, to match with the show's tempo, than \"Aang's\" smooth and calm scores. The storyline seems to be picking up quite nicely as well, with civil conflict brewing up in Republic City. The show is definitely making its own path and tone, and setting itself apart from \"Aang\".But I still found myself really missing \"Aang's\" serene environments, gentler characters, and the cute, quirky humor. In fact I kind of found it hard to warm up to the characters in \"Korra\"....Korra is overall a very cool character, but is too aggressive and forceful. I hope that changes throughout the show, as Avatar always shows the evolution of its characters. Her newfound city friends, as well, are not that likable and their friendship is a little distant -- Aang, Katara and Sokka's friendship was as naturally progressing, fun, and close as they get. I also really miss the silly humor! Who can forget the cabbage seller from \"Aang\", and Sokka's silliness. With \"Korra\"'s older cast and a very serious conflict and villain already introduced and confronted, I really want more humor to balance the show out.I think the show needs to calm down a bit, take a breath, and let its characters meaningfully interact a little more before ramping up the action to the 1000th degree. Still, a flaw due to excess is better than a flaw due to lack. The Legend of Korra is an excellent and well-crafted show, and I look forward to seeing it form into a series worthy of its predecessor.",

But before that inevitable cancellation befell the unluckiest guy in the business, \"Undeclared\" was a charming, intensely enjoyable little concoction.\"Undeclared\" doesn't just take the kids from high school to college, Apatow advances it into a contemporary setting, cuts the length in half and this time goes for straight comedy instead of a dramatic mix. Also families who felt they could gather around \"Freaks\" should hed the warning that \"Undeclared\" is decidedly more adult, delving into all the sophomoric humor and sexual situations you'd expect from a group of guys on their own for the first time - but under Apatow's lense, you've rarely see it with this level of sophistication.Mirroring Apatow's search for public acceptance, \"Undeclared\" stars Steven Karp (perfectly cast Jay Barucel, play quite possibly the most unabashedly geeky main character TV has given us) as our underdog college freshman who seeks to change his geeky high school image with his new found freedom at UNEC - the University of North Eastern California. With the help of his roommate, British ladies man Lloyd (Charlie Hunnan) and suite-mates Ron (Seth Rogen, \"Freaks and Geeks\", now blessed with a meatier roll and writing credit) and Marshall (Timm Sharp, \"Six Feet Under\") they seek any means to amuse themselves between the late-night cram sessions and all-day Girls Gone Wild binges. \"Undeclared\" captures the sheer boredom of the freedom that comes with college better than any show I've ever seen. Across the hall is Steven's new crush, Lizzie (Carla Gallo), and dorm hotty Rachael (Monica Keena, a star in the making). Most of the action takes place inside the dorm and like \"Freaks\" it is populated with a colorful group including suit-mate Susan Payano, \"the new Harris\" Jared Groddie, Amy Pohler and Steven's divorced dad, Hal (Loudan Wainwright III), who can't seem to stay away.This time, now desperate for a hit, Apatow is trying to hard to please, lining up big name guest star friends like Adam Sandler, Fred Willard, Will Ferrell, Mary Kay Place and Ben Stiller. But the real fun, particularly for Apatow fans, comes when the \"Freaks\" alumni start showing up and \"Undeclared\" becomes a full-on class reunion. Jason Segal about steals the series once again in the obsessive boyfriend role. Samm Levine, Martin Starr, Busey Phillips, Nattasha Melnick and Steve Bannos all make return appearances in new characters. Levine, in particular, is an absolute hoot as a pickle-obsessed frat leader in the must-see 2-part satire of fraternity life \"Rush and Pledge\" and \"Hell Week\".OK, I'll admit, neither \"Freaks and Geeks\" nor \"Undeclared\" may not sound like the most compelling thing in the world on paper. But Apatow's genius lies in his ability to create characters so real they could be your best friends and fosters a tightly cohesive chemistry among the cast. He makes us love each of them in some way. The show is made up of individual moments, a highlight being a dance-off between Keena and Payano that threatens to bring back OMC's \"How Bizarre\". The laughs live almost entirely on character bits. Like \"Geeks\", this is a show you lounge in. Its world is so lasting that, with only 13 episodes, \"Undeclared\" is one of those shows that grows in your mind the more you think about it and the further from it you get.The saddest part of all this is that \"Undeclared\" was canceled right as it appeared to have hit it's stride. The first half of the series, while still fun, is clearly a work in progress before the show finds itself and we kick into classic material in the last half. \"Freaks and Geeks\" is a modern masterpiece and it says a lot that this semi-sequel is a worthy follow-up. Those stung by the short life of \"Freaks\" should find solace in this gem. \"Undeclared\" was not just another trip to the clich\u00e9-free teen series for Apatow, but it is the quintessential modern college series. Hip, insightful, compact, funny and lots of fun. Of all the recent shows that where cut down too soon, \"Undeclared\" ranks high on the list. It is one of those TV shows, like \"Geeks\" that will be appreciated by those who don't even like TV. * * * * / 5",

In my (not-so) humble opinion, that's the moment at which the network started to go downhill.Okay, so Zoey 101 isn't exactly on a level with Pete and Pete. It's got elements of The O.C. in that it's based on upper-class lifestyles. But I'm not going to discriminate against it based on that. Any given show is going to be about a very small slice of society. This one just happens to be an upscale slice.It's a decent show. It's shot well, so it's visually entertaining -- something I can't say for most Disney and Nick shows. And, though it's classic preteen content, it's spun in a way that stops me from vomiting, as I do watching most other crap being peddled on children these days.That's saying something.

    "top_review": "Funimation is the company well known for the dubbing of the Dragonball series, which was not as good as it was several years ago during the peak of its popularity. However, they soon got hold of another anime to put out on our television screens. Bad, right? Wrong. YYH is the story of a street kid named Yusuke with unnatural and extreme fighting skills who becomes a Spirit Detective, a special official who battles demons who pose a threat to our Earth, after he surprises his boss for saving a child's life, something not expected because of his brash manner and horrible social life. From there, Yusuke is involved in many cases, ranging from returning artifacts to their rightful place to an Underworld fighting tournament, aided closely by his loyal friends and his girlfriend, who has a good hand on her as well. The best thing about this series is that the only real edit is the voicing (as far as the uncut version goes). Everything else is the same: the names of the people, about 90% of the dialog, and more importantly the music. It's the closest thing to the original version I've seen in a long time, which is a very good call in my opinion to a well dubbed anime. And the voice actors are phenomenal. Everyone fits their roles perfectly and knows how to execute a joke, verbal and slapstick, so well that I found myself rewinding the recorded episodes I have just to see them again. Nicely done. And the battles in the show themselves are very attention-grabbing and at times unpredictable. Yusuke may be winning a fight one minute and the next he can barely fight back because of his opponent's hidden technique they had all along. The fighters in this show can pull some unexpected tricks from up their sleeves and they are extremely intelligent and calculating in their each of their actions. They'll make you go \"Wow. I never saw that one coming\". Another good thing about the fighting is that long battles last no more than 5 or 6 episodes, unlike a 20 episode long battle in Dragonball Z. They get to the point quickly, with fireworks galore. These gripping moments never cease to let you go. And the characters themselves are outstanding. Their personalities are so well brought out and so diverse. Yusuke's reckless and free-spirited, while Hiei (pronounced Hee-ay for those who don't know) is a dark loner who is only interested in number one most of the time. They are so developed and life-like you can't help but imagine someone close who resembles of few characters to the letter. And as perfect as this all sounds, it has one major downfall. Because of the similarities of the basic storyline to DBZ, people tend to look at it as just a DBZ rip-off and skip it. If the likeness is forgotten, it can become a well loved anime by most people who see it is a bad show. In conclusion, YYH is a well done dub, as far as the uncut version goes. Wonderful voices, good humor, and battles that will have you hooked, all done without leaving out too much of the show's Japanese feel. Good job, Funimation, you've mastered the art of professional anime dubbing. Hey 4Kids, if you're reading this, maybe you'll learn something.",

With exciting CG dinosaurs and cleverly woven plot lines (which carry through each episode), this is an amazing new series that deserves to go on! Some have commented that the acting is poor, yet I think these guys and girls do extremely well, given that they are acting to CG for a large amount of time, and that is an extremely difficult thing to do.The plot lines are well thought out and well written, throwing everyday people into the path of prehistoric monsters and seeing how they deal with it. A wonderful combination of acting, writing and our own desire to occasionally escape the \"real\" world makes this a gripping series that you have to tune into each week.Great show, can't wait for series 2!!!",

    "top_review": "Babylon 5 is the greatest science fiction show in the history of television.A bold statement I know, especially when one considers the original series of Star Trek which is certainly the genre's most celebrated. It's true to say that Star Trek has had a much greater cultural impact and has lasted longer than any other SF show, but when watching it again, it has dated. I'm not questioning the brilliance of some early episodes - they're still well written and thought provoking - season 1 of the old series is still fantastic. However, Babylon 5 is the Star Trek for today in that it deals with issues in a modern context. Whereas ST was a bunch of cleverly disguised morality plays about 1960's issues like communism, nuclear war and racial prejudice, B5 deals with social control, economics, war, governmental corruption, social psychology and spirituality. Although the issues discussed in Star Trek haven't gone away, they're not foremost in the psyche of mr average anymore.Alongside the fact that B5 discusses issues at the forefront, it has many other virtues. The main one is that the story continues from episode to episode - even now when I re-watch season one (just released on DVD) I can see events taking shape that will lead to major plotlines in future years. I'm not just talking about Data gradually becoming more human or Worf tussling with the dying Kilingon Empire every 7 or 8 episodes ... I'm talking about characters and plots that can be seen to be evolving each week without an obvious good guys vs bad guys scenario.I can't remember how many times I've watched a B5 episode and had a flashback to an earlier one - the sudden realisation of the importance of an event that seemed insignificant is very satisfying. Even in the 5th series, you'll be thinking back to an episode in series 1 and feeling smug that you got it.'Ahhhh! That's what it meant!' You'll be saying that a lot.The characters are wonderfully fleshed out by some great actors. They're complex beings who have to deal with temptations and failings as well as triumphs and successes. Sometimes things go deeply wrong and (get this Trek Fans) IT'S NOT SORTED OUT BY THE END OF THE EPISODE!! That's right - people change realistically - everything's not reset each week! Don't get me wrong I'm a huge Trek fan myself, but it's always irked me that everything isjust so hunky dory (don't people have arguments on the enterprise?)It's very satisfying to see a character that you've come to know and love wrestle with their morals and sometimes make the wrong choices (just like we all do.) In the end, we all knew the various crewmembers of the Enterprise would do the right thing. You can't say the same for the characters on B5 - they're fallible and thus much more interesting.There's many other great things about the show, but for me, the story and the characters are the most important. Sure, I know it doesn't look as expensive as Star Trek and yes I know it's hard to get into because it's not a whole load of 'one shot' episodes! If you like Star Trek and consider yourself intelligent - step up to the next level and watch B5!I guarantee that if you stick with it for a while, you'll be glad you did because the payoffs are enormous.

    "top_review": "Clarissa Explains it All may have been modeled on the successes of 1) Ferris Bueler and 2) Blossom. Melissa Joan Hart really got her start on this Nickelodean comedy aimed for younger teen and some pre-teen audiences as Clarissa Darling, a teen girl who often had a few minor dilemmas to work out in each episode. If I were to watch this show now, I'd probably remark how extremely corny it is, but then again, the humor and depth (or lack there of) doesn't have to carry on with me as I get older, since that isn't the point.Clarissa Explains It All, nonetheless had some great things going for it. For one, it was one of the rare occasions that a show was headlined by a young teen girl, and a rather spunky one at that. Few times do we see this in the early 90s, other than Blossom and later, with another Nickelodean series, The Secret World of Alec Max. Something like Zach Morris and Ferris Beuler were able to do, Clarissa often addressed the audience, usually to reiterate how things are going or to give advice for solving those problems. And they were usually minor things, like dealing with a sneaky older brother, Furgeson, or getting out of some mundane chore. Harmless things like that as rarely did Nickelodeon, if ever, touch upon anything but neutral topics (save the short-lived half-hour news program). She was a likable character and not whiny or obnoxious, although her parents were usually nerds. She had a pet aligator named Elvis, a cool neighbor named Sam, and usually programmed computer games as the ideal way of planning a solution to her problems. It was an amusing show that tried to do things a little differently than the same old, same old. And it seemed to have worked, since the show lasted three years (which is still pretty good, considering).Nickelodeon did have a quite a few good teen and pre-teen based shows on air in the early 90s. Among them were 'The Adventures of Pete and Pete,' 'The Secret World of Alec Max,' 'Are You Afriad of the Dark?' and of course, 'Clarissa Explains It All.' Check out the show if you can. If American television continues creating garbage shows, then these kinds of shows are truly the last of their kind.",

We went Mrs. Edna Garrett played by the wonderful Charlotte Rae who got her own show without all the drama of Different Strokes. She escaped it. I never approved of them dissing Dixie Carter for Mary Ann Mobley. I like them both in the role as the second Mrs. Drummond. Of course, there was the guest appearances of First Lady Nancy Reagan preaching against drugs. How little did we know the truth? Gary Coleman never escaped the image of the chubby cute kid on Different Strokes. Dana Plato who is gone to a better place never did get to experience the life of Kimberly Drummond except when she was on the set. I only wish Todd and Gary best for their future. I only wished that the off-screen drama was cut down for their sakes. I feel guilty getting laughs knowing that they went home and cried or faced abuse.",

Funny, this started happening when John Diehl left the show. On the other hand, the first three seasons rocked. Some of those episodes were so hypnotic that there has never been anything like it. Here are my top 10 episodes of all time:1) Junk Love / November 8, 1985 2) Hit List / October 19, 19843) No Exit / November 9, 19844) Back In The World / December 6, 19845) Bought And Paid For / November 29, 19856) The Good Collar / October 24, 19867) Rites Of Passage / February 8, 19858) Viking Bikers From Hell / April 3, 19879) Shadow In The Dark / October 31, 198610) Walk-Alone / October 17, 1986Some of these episodes were so good that you wished they went on forever.

Plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future.While most producers and directors in Hollywood ignorantly view Sci-Fi as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations. This series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the \"shoot-em-up\" video game monster mentally of much of the current generation. It has brains, history, a message and good entertainment. It is an adult series without unbearable teenage know-it-all fantasies.

    "top_review": "It's hard to put into words how moving this documentary series was. The view of this work from 30,000 feet is perhaps that it is a beautiful but tragic depiction of the powerful versus the powerless in the context of the American criminal justice system, and a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of when we believe the ends justify the means. The view on the ground - from a very intimate front row seat in Steven Avery's hometown of Manitowoc, WI - is that one man likely endured not one, but two of the most egregious injustices imaginable. One thing that sets this series apart from previous shows in this genre (like NPR's Serial) is that the producers never once make an appearance on camera, nor does the viewer ever hear their voices, at least not in a literal sense. Instead, they rely on interviews, court proceedings, news clips, and telephone and video recordings to tell the story, often against the backdrop of the Avery's family compound. In a simple and clean way, the series is beautifully shot. And the story itself... unbelievable. But even the most reasonable, even skeptical viewer will have to grapple with the theories put forward. Theories that would seem a reach at best if it weren't for the overwhelming hard evidence unfolding, on film, right before your eyes. I started out by saying that it was hard to describe how moving this documentary was, and I actually found myself transitioning through the same emotional states (albeit to a much lesser degree) that the key figures seemed to experience: from shock and disbelief to anger and ultimately to a sense of despair. To me, what separates television and film that constitutes true \"art\" from that which is merely entertaining, is that it reveals something perhaps not so obvious but nonetheless true about human nature or the human experience. This easily surpasses that standard, but what makes it particularly chilling is that this is not a carefully constructed fictional plot designed to pull our heart strings. This actually happened. And it happened to real a person. To a real family.",

I am glad to say, after seeing the premiere, this is the 24 I have known and loved and it is everything a 24 nerd such as myself could wish for! I think using London as the setting was an inspired choice, as being a Brit myself, I love London and there is so many great locations to choose from. It's nice to see that, so far, the landmarks everyone associates with the place have been absent (Big Ben etc.)and instead, we see some of the seedier areas, which to me gives a good feel for the kind of life Jack Bauer has had to endure since he disappeared 4 years earlier.From the start, I love the energy, drive, enthusiasm and the feeling that the cast really wanted to be doing it (which is what made the Season 8 first episodes so flat because that was so obviously lacking). As ever, there are Jack's incredible escapes and anticipation of what people will do that make this always so exciting to watch. He's always one step ahead.The new characters, even at this early stage, seemed to be getting proper development in terms of depth, and the return of the earlier characters seemed quite natural and not contrived in any way.There is so much promise here for a powerful story, featuring the usual twists, surprises and shocks, it sure will be hard to wait for a week each episode.All in all, this new 24 still has the power to keep me glued to the TV as it always has, something that very few other shows have ever done, and I await the remainder eagerly.

Meanwhile, amid growing concerns over the use of US military drones in combat, President James Heller pays a visit to London to negotiate a treaty to continue their basing on British soil. Having heard rumors of an imminent attack against Heller, Bauer resurfaces in the city, where he is apprehended by the CIA and forcibly recruited into joining their investigation. As forces within the White House conspire against him, Bauer realizes that the complexity of the plot extends beyond a presidential assassination, and that the consequences of a successful attack will alter the course of history. With the help of a disgraced CIA agent and a hacker collective preaching free information, he must confront an unseen enemy whose personal vendetta threatens to push the world to the brink of war.",

It may take longer than that for others, but it's so worth it.Yes, there are a lot of sound effects. But I don't think people realize how important they actually are to the show. They help mindlessly guide the audience as to what feeling they are supposed to be having. (Much like canned laughter or sappy music on any other show. I mean, think about it, canned laughter is WEIRD, but we accept it as part of the show because we know where to laugh.) The show is genuinely funny, and the actors are pretty adept. I don't think enough people give James Maslow the appreciation he deserves for playing such a shallow character as well as he does. You may hate the character for his selfishness, but that's the point. Maslow's faces and timing are flawless. All the other boys are just as good. They are clearly overacting a la The Monkees, but that's what makes it great.To top it off, they all have amazing voices. I was shocked at the sounds coming out of these boys. (Mostly because I was expecting them to be terrible.) Kendall's voice is way beyond his years. Yes, there are some auto-tunes here and there. But I dare you to find a song these days that doesn't have that crap in it. It's \"cool\" for some reason. But these boys do have chops. I would also like to say that their covers of Beatles songs are also shockingly good.I have forced several of my friends to watch this show, all unwillingly, and they all admitted that it is pretty funny. The show doesn't take itself seriously. It reminds me also of the show 2gether from MTV that I thought was hilarious.Do I think their music is amazing? No. But it's catchy and fun. And if Snoop likes them, how can you go wrong??",

Fans of H. Jon Benjamin will love him as he brings his own dead pan cadence to Sterling Archer, a character that is arguably the most narcissistic is television history. The writing is quick and sharp, the animation is stylized and hip and the laughs come faster than you can catch them.In short, watch for this amazing show to come to your TV in January and prepare to be amazed.

This is a story about seemingly ordinary people and their work: FBI agents who enforce the law by arresting the people who break the law, as they've been taught in school. Hence, this job is much more complicated by the criminal mind learned to hide, to connect with all parts of society, only to avoid justice. Because of that, the ordinary people of the law have to work undercover, to look like criminals, to talk like them, to lie and do everything to arrest them. All that lying and erasing themselves could be very dangerous and who knows where could lead. I can't wait another episode, to see all the good and the bad in these characters that will come up!",

This program is produced and directed very well, there is a nice flow and speed going on, the scenery shots from the cities alone are worth more than 1 star so what's it to ya? Let me be very clear, it is Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and LA. Reid, you get exactly what is on the package and someone who's rating 9 stars for American Idol and 1 Star for The X Factor is a hypocrite. If you like American Idol you like this show, if you don't like American Idol you won't like this either. Opening the age limits is a fantastic decision because that gets really interesting later when the contestants will be split into Boys, Girls, Groups and over 30s and receive personal training from the judges and coaches. This is where the show will be different from Idol and since it has worked in other countries very well, it will work in American just fine, despite the hypocritical ratings on this website.If you're looking for something entirely different you won't find it here, but if you feel entertained by great voices and quirky auditions this is a great show to watch. As long there are 20,000 people auditioning in every city this show clearly deserves it's space.",

Its misfortune was to be produced during an era full of silly, mostly non-topical comedies (Beverly Hillbillies, Bewitched, My Favorite Martian and so on) and I think it's been underrated because of that.But sit down sometime and take a good look.  You'll see a  spirited ensemble performance from the actors, with standout work from Larry Hagman and Hayden Rorke.  I don't think Hagman ever got enough credit for the wonderfully manic and nervous mannerisms that made Major Nelson so damn funny and endearing.  And Rorke's prissy and arrogant Dr. Bellows was a terrific comic foil -- cartoonish in the best sense of that word.Bill Daily did a good comic turn as Major Healy, although I think his character never was allowed to develop as much as Hagman's and Rorke's. (His finest comic hour was to come, on \"The Bob Newhart Show.\")  And of course, there was the gorgeous Barbara Eden as Jeannie, sprightly and innocent and an excellent counterpoint to Hagman's world-weary astronaut.  The romantic chemistry between Jeannie and Tony was one of the strongest in TV history.The show was fast-paced, rarely sappy, full of pleasant \"NBC Peacock\" colors, and a showcase for fine comic timing and physical slapstick.",

So the arrival of the DVD was awaited with much anticipation. People often ask me to describe The Mighty Boosh - which is not an easy thing to do.Essentially the structure is that of a sit-com, in that there is the reoccurring location of the zoo, and a set of familiar characters most notably the two main protagonists \u0096 zoo-keepers Vince Noir (Noel Fielding) and Howard Moon (Julian Barratt). Vince is the fashion conscious shallow one, that plays against Howard's jazz loving, self-important but likable loser. Each episode is a juxtaposition of the Morecombe and Wise type banter between Vince and Howard, and the sheer surrealism of their subsequent adventures that take them to exotic locations and pit them against bizarre and often quite dark foes.For me the triumph of the show is due to the breadth of vision that links the fantastic theatrical visual look (based on largely on Noel's sketches), with Julian's love of music, together with the off-beat acting style and witty script to provide an experience that is more than the sum of its parts.There is nothing else quite like this on TV, you won't be splitting your sides every minute at quick-fire one-liners written by teams of caffeine stimulated comedy writers, but instead prepare yourself for a rather more gentle experience, peppered by some hilarious set-pieces, who's imaginative brilliance will ingrain itself into your heart and mind. It's quite simply lovable.",

Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical allegory: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the \"normal\", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/More reviews: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur15794099/comments",

A P.I. helps out digging up factual information. While in nearly every episode a criminal is found out and put behind bars, after testing out tactics in Shark's private mock court, Sebastian often also has to deal with his daughter Julie, who surprisingly chose after Shark's divorce to live with him rather than her mother in New York.",

    "top_review": "Like another reviewer has stated, when I first saw the trailer for Teen Wolf, I was totally uninterested. The only reason I watched the first episode was because it came on directly after the MTV movie awards and there was nothing else on TV. I was actually surprised by how good it was. The acting was good, the special effects weren't too cheesy, and there is something dark and edgy about it. I admit some parts of the plot are predictable, but then again, there are some things that flat out surprised me. The actor who plays Stiles is fantastic, and I think he is a big part of why I like the show. Also, Derek Hale's character isn't too bad on the eyes, either. After all this talk about how this is a Twilight rip-off online, I have to say that I think it's unfair to compare this to Twilight. Let's be real, Twilight has horrible acting, and the acting in Teen Wolf is actually decent. And the plot is completely different in my opinion. In Twilight, the story surrounds Edward and Bella's relationship; In Teen Wolf, I think the story is more about Scott's transformation into being a werewolf and the challenges it brings him. Yes, Allison (his love interest) is a part of those challenges, but the story does NOT revolve around their relationship. This show has a TON of potential, and I could definitely see them going above and beyond what they are doing now. But I am entertained for now and I will continue to watch the season until the end. 8/10",

Conan's first episode as host of the Tonight show was, to say the least, hilarious! He began the show by running from New York to L.A. to host the show. That's right. Watching Conan run across the country was funnier than Leno's monologue. Then, he began the show by doing his usual monologue in the set Universal built just for him. It's different from Leno's set since it's a more traditional talk show set with a little New York flavor. However, he did keep Leno's lighting which I thought was interesting. Conan followed the monologue by showing two hilarious remote pieces. One was Conan giving a tour of Universal Studios and the other was him driving his 1992 Ford Tarus around town. Then, the show lost some steam during the interview segment. The guest was Will Ferrell. I like Ferrell and he was funny but you couldn't ignore the fact that a show owned by Universal, being shot at Universal was promoting a movie by Universal. The show went from 30 minutes of hilarity to 30 minutes of promotions.Either way, it was a great episode. And I hope there's more great episodes to come. We've been waiting 5 years for this and it lived up to expectations. The best part is that Conan didn't really change a thing. It's classic Conan!",

Not quite like one of Ms. Reichs' novels, it is still a pleasure for a fan (me!) to watch. Boreanaz' past work on Buffy and Angel stands in good stead here as he delivers lines that stand up to a strong female role without diminishing it. Also like Buffy, humor lends grace to embarrassing social situations that highlight common human vulnerabilities. Surrounding the 2 major players are other characters who add to the thrust of a character driven show. The writers do good work giving each character unique attributes that have nothing to do with hair color or body measurements. The entire cast does a good job presenting real, quirky individuals who don't have to rely on looks to sell the worth of their character to the viewers. That alone is something new for any CSI show. Still some rough edges in writing and delivery (Tempe's \"I wish this was the worst I have seen\" was painful for all the wrong reasons),\"Bones\" has great potential.",

No, correction: it's an above average show that manages to actually be very funny, in addition to being very raunchy. Think about MTV's other semi-good teen comedy series, \"The Hard Times of RJ Berger.\" Like \"Hard Times,\" \"Awkward.\" has been easily influenced by the recent wave of popular teen comedies at the movies, most notably 2010's \"Easy A\" (this show's premise borrows a central plot element from that film).\"Awkward.\" is also heavily influenced by the films of the late John Hughes (1950-2009), that Brat Pack filmmaker behind such classics as \"Sixteen Candles\" (1984), \"The Breakfast Club\" (1985) (my personal favorite), and \"Pretty in Pink\" (1986). Using those movies as an influence for its plot basis, \"Awkward.\" tells the story of Jenna Hamilton (Ashley Rickards), a virtual 15-year-old nobody at a posh Southern California high school. She narrates the show through her online blog postings.It's clearly established early on that Jenna is in fact, quite wise beyond her years, so obviously that has got to make her a target from the more popular students. Rickards is able to give her character a sense of humanity and vulnerability, and Social \"Awkward\"-ness, that makes her seem like a real person and not a Molly Ringwald stereotype (a moment extremely late in the third episode really makes this clear). In fact, Rickards's Jenna Hamilton and Ringwald's bright-and-beautiful-but-socially-rejected John Hughes-era characters - Samantha Baker in \"Sixteen Candles\" and Andie Walsh in \"Pretty in Pink,\" namely - are so close in age (and emotional maturity) that it's entirely possible that Jenna *could* be Ringwald's offspring from those years.During the summer, Jenna had a brief affair with Matty (Beau Mirchoff), the hottest hunk in school, and said affair ultimately resulted in her losing her virginity. The problem is that Jenna and every other girl in school is lusting after Matty, who does in fact appear to have genuine feelings for Jenna but does not want to take their relationship public, for obvious reasons. As the season begins, the new school year has just started and we're shown Jenna's daily life as a societal outcast at her school, her promiscuous best friend Tamara (Jillian Rose Reed), and her overweight cheer-leading nemesis - and resident mean girl/queen bee - Sadie (Molly Tarlov).Before you know it, a freak accident one night in her bathroom results in a misconstrued rumor that Jenna had tried to commit suicide, and the rumor mill at her school goes ballistic with the news. A la Emma Stone's social-climbing Olive Pendergast in \"Easy A,\" Jenna is thrust to the top of the high school social ladder - she's the new \"it\" girl that everyone is talking about, for better or for worse - and she also has to deal with the common trials & tribulations of being a socially Awkward teenager on the verge of adulthood.\"Awkward.\" is a genuinely funny and entertaining show, if you have a thing for teen shows. Sure it rehashes a lot of what we've seen in the past to the point that it's pretty much overkill. And Lord knows we've seen enough teen comedies over the years to know what to expect from shows like this. But where \"Awkward.\" gets points is, I think, is its knowledge of its influences, namely the works of John Hughes. Hughes was known for complex, yet uniquely human portrayals of teenagers in his films and \"Awkward.\" appears to display some of the humanist complexities that Hughes had made his trademark back in the '80s. You can see it with Jenna and how torn she is between Matty and another popular hunk named Jake (Brett Davern).With this in mind, this series definitely shows promise, promise that I hope is not squandered on stupid sex jokes, humor, and raunchiness - although there is already plenty of that here.Awkward.8/10",

    "summary": "\"Awkward\" is about the specific incidents in our formative years that define us -sometimes for the best and sometimes for the worst. The show centers around fifteen-year-old Jenna Hamilton, who, like many, feels invisible to her peers and desperately wants to find her place--which is hard to do in a day and age where fitting in means standing out. Unfortunately, Jenna's visibility comes on the heels of an accident that gives her a not-so-fun stigma. And while the stigma of her accident could be the curse of her life, Jenna's determined to make it her life's blessing.",

    "top_review": "What can you say about Invader Zim? If I could, I'd just call it abso-friggin-lutley-fan-bloody-tastic and leave it at that. But I obviously can't do that or my review would be much too short.The show was about an alien from Irk, a military planet bent on conquering the galaxy. They did this by sending out invaders to study the planets' weaknesses, softening them up for the Irken armada. Enter Zim, who single-handedly ruined the first attempt at galactic conquest by accidentally attacking the planet. He's also very short and since height determines status on Irk, this is bad for him. He \"quits being banished\" when he hears about Operation Impending Doom II and begs the Almighty Tallest (leaders of the planet--remember the height thing)? for a second chance. They finally send him to a \"secret planet,\" expecting him to die and thus be out of their way for good. Zim doesn't die, but arrives on Earth, where he makes himself a very crude disguise and house. He joins the skool (I'm not kidding, that's the way it's spelled all throughout the show) hoping to learn more about the planet, and that's where he meets Dib. Dib loves paranormal things and is the only one who sees through the disguise...but of course no one believes him. From that point on, Zim tries to destroy the earth and Dib tries to capture/expose him for what he really is. This isn't a pathetic \"Ash and Team Rocket\" rivalry either. These guys think nothing of killing each other, especially in Zim's case. Look to episodes like \"Dark Harvest,\" \"Room with a Moose,\" and \"Nanozim\" for proof. It can get pretty dark, though still pretty appropriate for kids. My 9 year old cousin likes it fine. There are so many good things about this show I don't know where to begin. The animation is what you'd expect from Jhonen Vasquez, and puts other cartoons I've seen to shame (*coughWildThornberriescough*). The music matches the mood of the show, from the pulsing theme to the surreal disco of the Mexico scene in \"Walk of Doom.\" Flawless voice acting-especially with Richard Horvitz, who can turn Zim from evil to adorable in seconds, and Rikki Simons who masters Zim's idiotic robot slave, GIR. There's a lot of background behind the plot and characters. If you care to look, you can find information on the Irken's history, biology, and economy-it's really a smart show! The secondary characters are amazing too. Miss Bitters is the creepy teacher with some of the funniest lines in the show (\"The lesson here is that dreams inevitably lead to hideous implosions\"). Gaz is Dib's Gothic sister who plays video games nonstop. Even the people standing in the background can give you a laugh (and be sure to look for the many cameos!) And to think that all this was canceled, probably to make room for more Spongebob and Jimmy Neutron. The way Nick slowly killed the show through budget cuts and censorship proved they don't want to entertain older viewers like they did in the old days, so in a way the whole channel died with the show.Good-bye Zim. Thank you for the gift of laughter we can never repay.",

They trick him into going on a \"secret mission\" to an obscure planet at the edge of the universe, a planet with the unlikely name of Earth.

    "top_review": "Broad City came out of no where for me which might have something to do with why I like it so much. At this point only 4 or 5 episodes have aired but excluding the possibility that the show takes a 180 degree turn South, I can say with some certainty that this show is nothing short of awesome.I've been a loyal workaholics fan for 4 seasons now, which has the time slot on Comedy Central just before Broad city, but already I prefer the latter. After the season 4 premiere of Workaholics, the channel simply wasn't changed and my roommate and I found ourselves watching Broad City. Normally we would change the channel because generally when we watch TV we don't just watch random shows. The only time we watch new shows is when it's a conscious decision. HOWEVER, Broad City had enough humor and wit packed into the first minute that we were hooked enough to watch the entire episode. Now, 4 episodes later, he and I make sure to tune into Comedy Central every Wednesday at 10:30.The show rests on the shoulders of its 2 leads, Abbi and Ilana, who bounce off each other perfectly. Abbi is the more awkward, reserved pushover who takes sh*t from all angles (her roommate's super-mooch boyfriend, her boss, etc.). Ilana, on the other hand, does everything in her power at all times to take advantage of people because she's struggling to get by. But so is Abbi, which is why they make such a great team. They complete each other. When they're not together, they're on the phone or video chatting with one another. Ilana provides the more outrageous, in-your-face humor, while Abbi brings the more subtle, charming humor - but again, their collective humor makes for one of the most well-rounded female driven comedies.Naturally a comparison to Girls comes up precisely because it's a female driven comedy television show - not to mention it's revolves around young women struggling to get by in New York City. Girls has its own brilliance in its wit and deeper nuanced characters, but it also has a very dramatic side, which often borders on ridiculous. Broad City takes a completely different and refreshing approach. Like Workaholics, it shoots for raunchy comedic gags and very rarely stumbles into dramatic territory. Unlike Workaholics, it never becomes TOO stupid or TOO ridiculous. The guys of Workaholics are essentially caricatures, which can be very funny, but it also leaves you disconnected from them. The only reason we like them is because they're funny, but otherwise there is zero depth to any of them. That's where Broad City has the obvious upper hand on Workaholics. After a few episodes you already have a feel for who the girls are, which allows you to laugh even harder at their misfortune.",

The action scenes are very good, as you would expect with this kind of budget. The car scenes,which of course there are many (it is about a transporter after all)are well executed, and the fighting scenes are very reminiscent of the three films starring Jason Stratham. The locations are also recognisable from the films, including Frank's house before it was blown up, and Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and reprises his role as Inspector Tarconi.Chris Vance tries his best, and does extremely well considering what he has to work with, and while he is not Jason Stratham, I think he will grow into the role nicely, and will prove to be a good choice as Frank Martin.

It was almost reincarnated as this awful mindless program that made Johnny look almost retarded. Of course they would put old Johnny Bravo in re-runs, for a while, but then they stopped. About a year ago I entirely gave up on The Cartoon Network (with the exception to Family Guy, Futurama, Aqua Teen Hungerforce, Sealab 2021, and Harvey Birdman: A.A.L).

However, It's very funny & packed with quickfire gags, only a few of which fall flat. If you don't find one joke funny though, it doesn't matter because there are another 10 waiting round the corner & I don't care if some of them are old - they're still good. I actually find the old studio audience format refreshing & the addition of bad language & dirty jokes actually works pretty well. Plus, it's great to see the cast dropping out of character from time to time to have a giggle at the gags. They look like they're actually having fun! The pace of it is incredible & it really takes some talent to pull a sitcom like this off so well. it's not cool or edgy but so what? It's funny! So many recent comedies are not.",

    "top_review": "Berserk is by far the best anime that I have ever seen. Nothing even comes close to capturing the interest of the viewer and holding it tightly throughout the ten hour duration of this masterpiece. Firstly, I must admit that it has its flaws, such as a few points of lazy animation, as in some of the battle scenes, as well as the somewhat disappointing ending, which leaves the viewer thirsting for more without the promise of any follow-up. Yet the fact of the matter is, and I speak for myself, that the positive aspects of Berserk outweigh the bad so drastically one cant help but overlook them in terms of the entire film. The frequent sub-par visuals mean nothing in comparison to the amazing plot depth and beautiful character development marbled throughout the film. In summary, Berserk is a ten hour mini-series that consists of 25 20+ minute episodes detailing the life of a rogue swordsman named Guts. Guts, in short, is simply the most intriguing fictional character ever constructed. Guts, first of all, is one of the finest examples of an individual driven entirely by self preservation and improvement. Throughout the series Guts grows stronger and more deadly before our eyes, with each thrust of his massive sword. The personal relationships that he develops over time, especially with Griffith and Caska, are totally believable and honest. In particular, the love/hate relationship that Guts has with Caska sucks the viewer into their world and with each episode end leaves you literally thirsting for more. I can honestly say that I had never so anxiously awaited a release as I did with each progressing volume. The score, other than being entirely redundant, creates an additional emotional appeal that quite literally leaves a mark in your mind. The opening theme song, although an acquired taste, becomes somewhat of a necessity to mark the beginning of each additional episode that will bring you deeper into the world of Guts and the Band of the Hawk. In no time at all you find yourself singing along with it as if it were a top forty tune. The climactic theme played every 3 episodes or so, is absolutely haunting, leading one to wonder how it came to be included in an anime. Berserk is a definite must-see for all fans of anime. For those who dislike anime or are indifferent to it, the mediocre visuals may tarnish your opinion of it, yet the rock solid plot and character depth with leave you amazed.      Rating: Animation Quality: 7/10         Character Development: 10/10         Plot Line: 10/10         Overall Enjoyment: 12/10 (If that's at all possible)",

But as the \"Shadow of malevolence storyline unfolds, it is clear that Star Wars is back in star wars territory. Great little storyline, and episode 3 is just true to the spirit of the original Trilogy and yet keeps with the clone wars setting. Episodes 4 & 5 are even better, and as a listener to the podcasts on theforce.net the interviews are brilliant too. The creators are aware of what we like and don't and they reassure us not to worry, as some very cool stuff is still in the pipeline. I even rewatched the clone wars movie again now its out on DVD and i like it 10 times better than i did before. I guess everything was new. I also found out that the movie was the first stuff they filmed for the series and that everything that has come since has been improved upon, and much has yet to be seen. I am looking forward to the episode i saw in a clip where we see a flashback of General Grievous become what he is now. Anakins character is actually likable now. And Asoka is less brattish than she was in the movie. Just a shame about the damn droid voices. Less is more sometimes eh! Well done George and the team. So far i'm loving it, and cant wait for each episode. Finally, some of us may actually understand what GL was trying to achieve with the prequels. The kids love it too. I hope it gets a little darker though, or at least remains at the level of the malevolence storyline. Cant wait for the LIVE ACTION show next year too, but I hope that one is gonna be dark and for the fans, and not for the kids. (As promised.) Then, i think balance will be achieved. Clone wars for the kids, fine. But if they make Star Wars TV for the fans, all may be forgiven.Oh, one last thing... Needs a little bit more John Williams score. Pleeease??? _______________________EDIT: 2010OK, series 2 is now half way through.... WOW!!!! It has just changed completely, series 1 was great with teathing troubles as I stated in my review. But series 2, THIS IS STAR WARS!! And its a shame to say it, especially as i didn't mind the prequels too much, but I wish they would re-do the prequels in this animated style. 100 times more character than the live action. I now LOVE this show. My only gripe now is with the Cartoon network, who keep skipping weeks of showing it. People keep missing it and viewing figures will drop, and its the show that will get the blame yet its because its hardly aired consistently. This has happened with LOST and other great TV. People miss it and then forget about it. TV is based on viewing figures, so let us view it damn it!Keep em coming and thank G for the darker more adult turn of series 2.",

Some key examples of this would be the new Batmobile, Joker, Poison Ivy and Harley. The Characters don't have the depth they had in TAS, they come off as silly little cartoon characters. And the Joker keeps coming off as a common thug, not the Psychotic genius he should be. Bruce Wayne is too cold and calculating instead of a tortured soul fighting for justice.But the show has its ups, Some of the storylines really benefit from the increased flexibility offered by WB. The crossover with supergirl really shows this. And the inclusion of Nightwing is awesome, he really adds some much needed depth to the show. His struggle with Bruce was really well handled, with the exception of Bruce being so cold as mentioned above.Overall the show is still better then 99% of TV today, but doesn't quite live up to the greatness that was TAS.",

It is set in a medieval world where humans co-exist with bloodthirsty yoma (demons). The only way to stop these monsters is to call upon the fearful half-yoma/half-human women warriors named after their main weapon: the Claymore. This show follows the story of one Claymore, Clare, as she slays demons with a young human boy, Raki, that lost his family to the yoma. This is not just any \"monster of the week\" type of show: character development is a key part of the story and it gets more and more interesting with every episode. This is still a good show to watch for those not that familiar with the Japanese Anime genre. Even though I am not an anime fan, I can still say that it is one of my favorite TV series if not the best. This anime series is definitely not fun and fuzzy like Pokemon or Inuyasha, nor is it full of filler episodes like Dragonball Z where its takes a whole day to watch somebody go super quadruple invincible God Mode. There is action in every episode and you will not be disappointed. Be careful, there is a lot of blood and gore present in the series: it is not a show for the faint-hearted.",

    "top_review": "My remorse at not discovering this wonderful comedy before its syndication origins last fall cannot be matched.  I didn't even find the show as enjoyable at first as I do now until a time later still, when I unearthed the roots of the plot and actually comprehended the inside jokes.  I find this a phenomenal, unique show, a refreshing touch amidst an enormous accumulation of 'single-people-in-the-city' comedies (although some of these are worthy amongst themselves).  I love the ingenious concept of providing insights of human culture, civilization, and particularly behavior in such a comical, hilarious method.  Bizarre components of humanity I would never have noticed are cleverly pointed out in this terrific series!The entire cast does an outstanding acting job, each performer portraying their character as vividly and illustriously as possible.  From the moment I was introduced to Dick, Tommy, Sally, and Harry, I fell in love with them - each one is so comical and likeable, their separate characteristics distinctly shown, yet their vulnerability blends them in so closely.John Lithgow does a brilliant depiction of the hopelessly gullible and seriously self-centered Dick Solomon.  His emphatic, articulate voice and precise comic timing are simply excellent.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as my favourite character, the charming Tommy, is just as equally talented.  The notion of having the oldest, wisest alien reduced to a teenager is hilarious.  His intelligence, quirks, and constant snappy wisecracks are marvelous.Kristen Johnston as Sally is an absolute scream.  Though not as conceited as Dick, she is very advantageous of her outrageously attractive self, and boisterously so.  Mini-skirts look terrible on a tall, leggy person, but Sally doesn't seem to think so!  Finally there's oddball Harry (French Stewart), who contributes more than is necessary to his share of 'stupid humour' on the show, but his part is very cunningly scripted and acted, making him flat-out hilarious rather than just stupid and senseless.  His nearly-closed eyes, those incompatible, goofy patterned clothes (furry jacket!), and that voice, oh, classic.The amusing supporting characters are nothing to sneeze at either. Deadpan Jane Curtin as the neurotic Mary, Simbi Khali as Nina, with her humorous keen remarks, the deliciously funny Elmarie Wendel as the eccentric, lustful old lady Dubcek (`Italian gentleman. very nice.'), and Wayne Knight as Officer Don, he cracks me up with his chubby figure and inability to yield to Sally's charms!  The assortment of dim-witted students in Dick's physics class are great too: idiots Pitman, Bug, and especially Leon, and the chatty Caryn, are always funny.Interestingly enough, 3rd Rock has featured a collection of very impressive guest stars over the years - Kathy Bates, William Shatner, Michael Hasselhoff, John Cleese (don't miss his episodes!), and many colourful others.The script is sincerely superb, each episode providing fresh new laughs, renewing old ones and an intriguing scenario.  In a way it is less a modernistic sitcom-type show than a comic book put to life.  It's the subtle, clever jokes that make me believe this.  Meanwhile, 3rd Rock is chock-full of various jokes and gags ranging from clever satire, dirty humour, sarcasm and wit, and other forms of amusement that don't need classification.Kudos to everyone involved in this fabulous, hilarious production, and let's hope for many more glorious seasons!",

One would have to have the brain cell(s) of the Prince Regent not to enjoy this series.  It is brilliant......sarcastic, cutting, witty, beautifully written, beautifully acted and generally outstanding.  Rowan Atkinson is not the Mr. Bean we are used to......as Edmund Blackadder, he hits his comedy stride as the conniving butler to the Prince Regent.  We miss the Percy character in the third series but Hugh Laurie, as Prince George more than makes up for his absence.  Baldrick is still with us and still has \"cunning plans\" but his IQ has taken a definite drop in score.If you want to laugh until you weep, then catch BA3 on BBCAmerica or better yet, go out and buy the tapes and the book \"Blackadder, the Whole Damn Dynasty\".  It will keep you amused for years to come as this type of humour does not date.  Rowan Atkinson, we salute you!!!!",

Wodehouse should bear in mind the following points;i)  Wodehouse was a highly prodigious writer ii) All of his stories feature upper class idiots iii)There is always a happy ending iv) The plots are never plausible v)  None of the first four points will prevent you from enjoying his work vi) Wodehouse is one of the greatest ever writers of English prose.A surprising variety of humourists have been influenced by Wodehouse, including Peter Cook, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Ben Elton, Spike Milligan, Woody Allen and even Billy Connolly.Television and film adaptations are rarely as good as the original book, but this production is about as good as it gets. Apart from Stephen Fry being rather too young at the time to play Jeeves, the casting is nearly perfect, particularly Hugh Laurie as Wooster.There are time constraints on television programmes that books are not limited by. There is also the problem that Wodehouse was at his best in narrative passages rather than with dialogue. Nevertheless, this programme will still make you laugh out loud. Great music too.Better still, read the books. Not just the Jeeves and Wooster titles, but also the Blandings series, Psmith, Mr. Mulliner and Ukridge books.Whatever your taste in comedy, The Fast Show or Last Of The Summer Wine, Dad's Army or Monty Python, the chances are that PG Wodehouse will make you laugh.'Jeeves and Wooster' still crops up on satellite and cable channels.

    "top_review": "Watching two episodes of \"Wallander\" makes me think of Isabelle Huppert's line in Hal Hartley's great \"Amateur\": \"everything I write comes out sad. Why do you think that is?\" Kenneth Brannagh's shambling, weary detective Kurt Wallander is as far from TV's 'Columbo' as it's possible to get, despite certain physical similarities.In a way that I seem to recognise as uniquely Nordic, Wallander goes about his daily business \u0096 solving murders \u0096 with a residual sadness on him and his world, and everything in the show \u0096 from the art-house photography and pared-down sets, to the score, to his life and to each episode's stories themselves \u0096 helps create a consistent portrait, so that by the time I settled down for episode two, Wallander's appearance was an automatic trigger to a certain state of mind.Each classy episode takes its time, draws visual comparisons, sets Wallander up in his world, makes you know him better. I'm loving it : it's on a par with the excellent French TV thriller \"Engrenages\" that previously appeared on BBC4, and anything ever so slightly formulaic about the story lines in each episode is offset by the serious and committed acting, the well-drawn characterisation, the consistent visual tone. I'm so glad they avoided the Meryl Streep world of accents and wholesale removal of the drama to the UK (or USA). These are Swedish characters in a Swedish town who write in Swedish \u0096 it's just that we're hearing them in English. And this technique allows them to cast truly excellent English supporting actors without any fear of uneven accents or geographic transitions that don't work so well. (No English forest ever looks quite like a Scandinavian one. And the British don't so much do sadness and mournful humour, as bleakness and black humour \u0096 they're quite different.)I saw Kenneth Brannagh as an electrifying 'Hamlet' on stage in the late 80s, and this feels something like being reacquainted with an old ghost. He's no longer young, and he's not beautiful, but he makes masterful use of his eyes, his voice, the very weariness life has given him \u0096 to create a memorable man, not just a cartoon portrait. Highly recommended.",

    "top_review": "\"Married with Children\" is the kind of show that does nothing for civilization and has no moral value...yet I got some of the biggest laughs in TV history from this show.  It is still one of my all-time favorites.  I even enjoy watching the repeats over and over again.  That's when you know a show is great.As for Al Bundy, could they have created a funnier TV character than him? He is one of my favorite TV characters, and I sometimes try to imitate him. My friends even jokingly thought of starting a \"No Ma'am\" group of our own. Speaking of \"No Ma'am\" one of my favorite episodes is the one where Al starts his own Church, in order to avoid paying taxes.  He rants and raves like the stereotypical evangelist, only he has two scantily-clad women by his side.  Then Marcy and her feminist group come marching in, showing everyone pictures of Al and Peggy on a romantic date.  Everyone gasps.  In response, Al imitates Jimmy Swaggart by shedding tears and screaming out, \"I have sinned.\"  That was genius!  When they one day show a retrospective of the funniest moments in TV history, that scene should definitely be shown. Ed O'Neill plays the character so perfectly, and I was amazed to see that he's actually nothing like his character in real life.  He's a very nice, soft-spoken guy.  Yet he couldn't be any more convincing as that character. Al Bundy will be his legacy!The supporting cast is great.  David Faustino, Christina Applegate, Katey Sagal, David Garrison and Ted McGinley are all very talented.  But I could never understand why Bud had trouble getting girls.  Faustino's a pretty good-looking guy.  Acting-wise, he couldn't be any better, but they could've picked a less attractive actor to have his persona be more convincing.Yes, the show may appear to be misogynistic.  All the female characters are either airheads, whiny housewives or overweight.  But I think in a way it's poking fun at misogynism.  I don't think the show ever glamourizes the act of misogynism.  Just look at the male characters.  They're a bunch of beer-drinking slobs.  Would you want to follow their philosophies on life? But I do admit, I enjoy the presence of many scantily clad babes on each episode.  Hey...if women want to make a show where macho guys appear on every episode in thongs, be my guest!  I won't watch it, but it doesn't offend me.  If women find \"MWC\" offensive, don't watch it!  You have a remote--use it!There are so many memorable moments on the show that I will have to take up this whole message board to jot them all down.  I will just mention two:When Peggy painted the bathroom pink and made it girly-looking, and Al was frightened at the sight of it.  So when the inspectors came to check it out, Al empties a bag with five sandwiches inside.  The song \"Bad to the Bone\" plays as Al scarfs down every sandwich, drowning each one with hot sauce. He grabs a newspaper, tucks it under his arm and runs straight to the bathroom.  The inspectors come running out, the toilet flushes and Al leaves the bathroom proudly.When Al accidentally got circumsized.  He would be afraid to look at anything even mildly stimulating because he was afraid a stitch would break.But as much as I liked the show, I felt good that it was cancelled. Because the last season reeked!!!  I don't know what went wrong, but the writing was drab and contrived, the acting was flat--Al didn't seem like Al anymore! He was actually turning into sort of a nice guy!  The show lost all its energy. But for all the previous seasons, I absolutely adored the show.  And I regard it as a classic!My score:  9 (out of 10)",

My favourite episodes and books are still Welcome to Dead House, The Haunted Mask, Ghost Beach, The Ghost Next Door, Night of the living Dummy 2 and A Night in Terror Tower.I would overall give RL Stines Goosebumps 10/10 stars as a good young person's creepy show.

    "top_review": "Dominion seems to be the successor to the 2010 film \"Legion\". For those that don't remember it the plot is as follows, God abandons the Angels and they decide its mankind's fault, and thus the apocalypse is born. One angel alone amongst his brethren sides with humanity, and comes to a remote diner to protect one expecting mother whose child is prophesized to be mankind's only hope of survival.Dominion is set a significant while after the invasion, where by all accounts the demonic (angelic) invasion wiped out all but a few walled off highly defensible cities holding the last of human kind (the one we see bares a strong resemblance to Fallout's New Vegas), and then became somewhat dormant.The show has believable sets and effects, some interesting stylistic choices on armor and swords and city architecture. The plot isn't incredibly unique, but its not derivative enough that you will know the seasons plot after one episode. Although you likely will guess whats happening throughout the episode 30 seconds before it does happen, nothing is all that surprising. Decent fight scenes, acting that's up to par, multiple sources of adversity from the Angelic threat to your own people, with one particularly self deluded villain that you will instantly not like. They highlight some social issues like caste systems and economic disparities, which might become important to the story later down the road.Everything about the pilot is promising, if you're into fantasy entertainment this probably will excite you. Word of caution, only the pilot is released, and its from the Syfy network which doesn't bring its A game often (ever?). The only recently decent show from Syfy was Helix, which started out equally powerfully with no overt mistakes and a promising premise, but the more episodes of it you saw the more obvious it was that the possibilities you imagined in response to all the mysteries the show introduced were vastly superior to the illogical garbled mess the story turned into by the end of the season. I enjoyed the pilot, but if you're short on time wait for a while to see if the show maintains its quality.",

    "top_review": "One Tree Hill is Warner Brothers latest effort to emulate the success of its popular 90's teenage show Dawsons Creek and it a very good job overall. This show really will appeal to the teenage audience, and young adults and it is very plot driven to this age range. The show deals with a lot of sensitive issues that teenagers face such as: sex, drugs,marriage, adoption, affairs, conflicts etc.The show is set in the fictional town of One Tree Hill and it stars: Chad Michael Murray as honest, likable Lucas Scott, James Laferty as spoilt rich child Nathan Scott, Hillarie Burton as the lonely but good hearted Peyton and Sophia Bush as the feisty but popular Brooke. The actors and actresses cast in these young roles really are the eye candy of the show. They all put in good performances and are totally believable in their roles.Backing up the cast are a set of adult actors and actresses and these really add another depth to the show. Paul Johansson (Dan Scott) and Moira Kelly (Karen Scott) deserve mentions as they put in great performances as the respective struggling single mother and evil father of the boys. Craig Sheffer (Keith Scott) does a strong performance as Lucas step father and Dan Scotts bother, Barbara Alyn Woods (Deb Scott) makes a good long suffering wife and mother to Dan and Nathan look believable and Barry Cobin does a sturdy performance as Coach Whitey. The adult actors really shine in this show and they help to make the characters interact as well as the children on the show.Underneath the shows skin is the running pulse of the conflict between long-lost brothers Nathan and Lucas Scott and that is what the whole show is built on. This show works so well is because it allows the adults as much air time as the teenagers and this lets the viewers care much more about all the characters, not just the teenage ones.The characters are nearly all beautiful, teenage girls will droll over the eye candy of Lucas and Nathan and the teenage boys will droll over Brooke and Peyton. But the fact is that these characters are all very well written and it means that the audience identifies and likes each of the characters in their own unique way. They are certainly not two dimensional characters and as the actors and actresses can act means they are believable. One Tree Hill is one of the most underrated shows on Television, and this is due to the fact that most people dismiss this show at first hand because they compare it with other teenage shows such as The OC and thats not really fair. This show has some human like quality that makes the show seem down-to-earth and relevant to many people. It does not have the fan base popularity that other teenage shows have, but it nevertheless has a very loyal set of viewers who tune in every week to watch the latest comings and goings on in Tree Hill.There are some very good episodes of this show, but some others that aren't so good. But the show always churns out consistently good episodes and this means it is much harder to judge how good the show really is in its genre. If you want to see a good solid teenage drama that deals with real issues, in a human way, this is the show for you. Don't miss it 10/10",

Its greatest talent ever was Dan Scott, who now runs a successful car dealership. The present talents are his two sons, Nathan Scott, a beautiful and popular athlete, the absolute star, who was molded and stifled by his proud dad, ambitious Dan Scott, who pushes him harder then even the coach approves of, but rather neglected by his spoiled, impulsive mother Deb, an alcoholic, and Lucas, abandoned at birth with his devoted mother, hard-working caf\u00e9-owner Karen Roe, who grew up with Dan's older but poor brother Keith as substitute father as a social reject, only playing hoops on a public yard in the park with street-kids, his passion being reading; when an incident forces the coach to replace suspended players, Lucas soon proves ...",

A few elements carried over, like the Sandworms, but there are no Maitlands, Lydia is much younger, and Beetlejuice has been rewritten from a sleaze-ball into...well, okay, he's still a sleaze-ball, but a LOVABLE sleaze-ball. He is Lydia's best friend (though how they met is never explained) and in addition to being able to summon him by saying his name three times, she can also send herself into his world, the Neitherworld, which introduces us to new characters such as Jacques the fitness-crazed skeleton, Ginger the tap-dancing spider, and the Monster Across the Street. Of course the real reason to watch the show is Beetlejuice himself.The quality of the animation itself is superb, especially considering that this was a late eighties/early nineties cartoon. Compare the quality of the animation to other Saturday morning shows at the time and you'll see that this was top-notch. Heck, they even made use of CGI years before it became commonplace. The writing, too, has held up surprisingly well over the years. True, the show relies a lot on puns and sight gags, so if you don't like that sort of thing, this isn't for you. But they also happen to be GOOD puns and sight gags.All in all, it's definitely more than a worthy successor to the movie. Why hasn't it been released on DVD yet??",

And of course, highly-prominent were the star-fields of space, the \"last frontier.\"This is the sort of stuff that was touted as being in our future at the Seattle World's Fair in 1962, the \"Century 21\" Exposition.As to the cartoon itself, it was amusing how the characters found themselves interacting with the technology of their time- the daughter blabbering on the phone, the son off pursuing his projects or grumbling about school, mom finding that the food dispenser requires a refill, dad returning from work moaning about how exhausted he is from a long hard day of pushing buttons, the bullying boss, and so on.In 1962, \"Cen.21\" touted the future as being, if not perfect, then at least far more congenial than the (then) present. The cartoon stated that this would not necessarily be so- and our own world of the 21st century has proven that the latter was more right than wrong, sociologically speaking at least.",

    "top_review": "Okay, let me start off by saying that, on the whole, I don't like anime very much. I've enjoyed a couple of the oft-cited \"classic\" series, but regard the medium as a whole in exactly the same way that I do American television: namely, that a good 90-95% of it is utter tripe, with the remainder falling anywhere from \"watchable\" to \"decent.\" This being the case, it's no wonder that I don't like the self-deprecating anime parodies out there. I don't get most of the jokes, and the medium itself enforces a certain style of humor that doesn't appeal to me at all - loud, hyperactive, lowbrow, and completely over the top.So, when I started watching this series at the behest of a friend, I was primed for disappointment after the first couple of episodes. I figured that the characters were supposed to represent clich\u00e9 characters from shopworn story outlines, and that their actions were supposed to be similarly satirical. I could kind of see where it was coming from, but didn't think that it was all that clever - lots of \"wacky, fun-filled high-school shenanigans and goings-on, only now we're being ironic about it.\" At about the third episode, my opinion drastically changed.It was at that point that the strengths of this series started to manifest themselves. The quirks of the non-chronological episode order, its snarky sense of self-awareness, and, above all, clever humor with (gasp) a well-executed straight man.In what I consider to be a rarity in any medium, this show presents well-thought out, witty interactions between diametrically opposed characters. Protagonist Kyon's perpetual sense of vaguely annoyed resignation provides the perfect foil to the actions of title character Haruhi's generic \"anime-like\" exploits. It's a break from formula, and it works incredibly well.Based on that strong foundation, the series further succeeds with a truly phenomenal level of attention to detail. As previously stated, the episodes air out of chronological order. I considered this to be a gimmick at first, but it works surprisingly well. The chronological sequence of events makes sense logically, but the aired order of the episodes more closely follows the traditional structure of Aristotelian drama. The order chosen leaves no narrative gaps that cannot be filled by simple inference (but while it is possible to guess what happened in an unaired \"preceding\" episode, one still feels compelled to watch exactly how those events unfold), and superb planning prevents any plot holes or contradictions. I watched this series a second time immediately upon completing it the first time, and I was amazed at how well even seemingly inconsequential events were all tied together.The last point is indicative of the extreme attention to detail in every area of the series. While the stock \"anime\" character designs grate a bit, the background art is exquisite, realistically rendered based upon actual photographic references. Animation quality is also excellent at important points. For example there is a musical performance late on in the series in which the characters are shown actually playing a song - this may sound trivial, but the subconscious effect of watching (film-quality) animation which actually corresponds to the soundtrack is incredible.In short, I love this series for some reason. By its very nature it is something that I generally dislike, but its execution is so unique and well-carried out that I can't help it.",

The witty and snappy comments compliment the new character types not too often seen on TV. Original script with lines you can use in an everyday life. I must admit - I stole some and already used a few.Without a doubt, one of the best progressive comedies as of late. A must see! However, a warning: if you are accustomed to the typical, safe boilerplate comedies, this will probably not be for you. If you lack the necessary humor it could be viewed as extremely offensive on several levels - not intended as such.

Explosions, when all else fails.I like 'The Unit' (also on CBS) when it addresses the egregious use of force needed to defend against force and the guilt that comes from fighting evil with evil actions. They have their moments of destruction far from home and leave the guilt for later (when they are home). Flashpoint takes place down the street. In your office building or mall. The consequences of action or inaction are to be replayed in their mind, home, community and above all on TV. And despite the preparations our heroes take, it just doesn't assuage the situations that go tits up.This show is grounded in moral motives that will pierce the heart of it's viewers. Let the Rambo's have their shows, and let us tread the thin, ever moving and twisting thin blue line of Flashpoint. In the show's own words, \"We're not here to target practice, we're here to save lives\".",

    "critic_rating": "7.6", 
    "top_review": "\"The A-Team\" is a guilty pleasure for the two generations of viewers who have embraced the series. It never attempted to be \"Masterpiece Theater\", but 'cotton candy for the brain', with the best episodes replaying the same scenario over and over (Underdog gets mauled by Big Bad Villain and his Baddies...calls in Our Heroes, who end up defending the Underdog on a 'deferred payment' plan...Our Heroes Stomp the Baddies, then get themselves captured...in true \"MacGiver\"-like fashion, they use the materials at hand, creating homemade lethal, yet non-fatal weapons in insanely short order...the Baddies are Crushed, and Our Heroes split, seconds before the Authorities arrive to arrest them). What made the series so popular was never the 'ritual' of the plots, however; if you loved the show, it was because of the chemistry of the stars. Hannibal, B.A., Face, and Murdock were all likable guys, and seemed to enjoy every moment together...and fans of the series have always 'picked up' on that camaraderie.The brainchild of Stephen Cannell and Frank Lupo, NBC loved the concept of the show, and gave the series a prime 'starting' point, airing the pilot episode after a Super Bowl, guaranteeing great initial ratings. Featuring Tim Dunigan as 'Face' (Dirk Benedict was unavailable for the pilot), the show benefited enormously from Mr. T's presence, as ROCKY 3 had made him an overnight star. Another 'plus' was George Peppard's return to weekly television; his \"Banecek\" had been a much loved NBC series, until he walked off the show (Cannell, one of the writers of the earlier series, understood the ex-alcoholic Peppard's occasional mood swings, and offered him a large salary and a lot of creative control in the new series, resulting in one of the happier periods in the actor's tragic life).A major discovery for \"The A-Team\" was Dwight Schultz, as 'Howling Mad Murdock'. A remarkably versatile actor, Schultz was adept at accents, physical humor, and rapid-fire one-liners, and his exchanges with Mr. T were funny without ever being demeaning. Peppard took a liking to the young actor, as well, and the warmth between the pair could be seen in nearly every episode. With Benedict's arrival (he had been the break-out star of \"Battlestar Galactica\", and had a large female following), Peppard had all the elements he felt were needed to make \"The A-Team\" work...which didn't bode well for the one female regular, Melinda Culea, as reporter Amy Allen. Although she gave the show a more balanced slant, and was excellent in her role, Peppard always considered her a 'fifth wheel'...and when Cannell did not renew her contract for the third season, it was generally assumed that George Peppard used his leverage to oust her. A new female character was introduced, played by Marla Heasley, but her character would remain less active, and would have a story 'arc' that would have her leave the series in 1985.A television show with a single concept, no matter how enjoyable the cast, can't run indefinitely, and by the end of the fourth season, \"The A-Team\" had pretty well exhausted all the variations the writers could imagine. Entertainment figures (Hulk Hogan, Boy George and the Culture Club, Rick James, Isaac Hayes) appeared in weak efforts to bolster ratings, and NBC pressured Cannell to make major changes to the series.Bowing to network pressure, the fifth season began by having the A-Team finally captured and court-martialed. Escaping with the aid of new regular Frankie Santana (Eddie Velez), the team soon found themselves 'prisoners' of a secret government agency run by Gen. Hunt Stockwell (Robert Vaughn), who offered them full pardons if they would take on a number of assignments \"too risky\" for the U.S. intelligence community to handle. The episodes sank to formulaic \"Mission Impossible\" clones, with George Peppard's authority lost to new boss Vaughn, and the 'blue-collar' charm of the earlier seasons sadly absent. When the series was canceled, while fans mourned, few were surprised.What has been a surprise is the 'cult' status the series has achieved in the years since it left the air. While George Peppard never lived long enough to see it happen (he died in 1994, from pneumonia), the still-growing popularity of the show has been a source of pride and amazement for Benedict, Schultz, and Mr. T (who nearly died of cancer, but has made a complete recovery), and the show is about to re-emerge as a feature film, with Stephen Cannell producing. Not bad for a 'single concept' series!",

Suchet's performance as the fussy little Belgian detective was a joy. Every detail of the character was perfect, from the stilted, pedantic delivery to the exquisitely fastidious grooming.  Suchet's skill as an actor was such that he was able to turn a rather flat, implausible character (and even fans of Agatha Christie admit that her characters are pretty two-dimensional) into a complex, eccentric but essentially believable person.  Some of the credit for this also goes to the fine writing in the series.  The writers were responsible for fleshing out the bare bones provided by Christie's stories, but they did it in such a way that the filmed versions flow naturally and seamlessly.  The supporting actors were also very fine, especially Hugh Fraser as Captain Hastings - whereas in the stories Hastings, who is usually the narrator, remains a rather sketchy character, here he becomes a genuine person.  He is not Poirot's mental equal by any means, but admirable in his sympathy, kindness and general embodiment of Englishness, and we can understand Poirot's affection for Hastings.  It's difficult to see how this dramatization can be improved upon.",

IMHO, and Kristen Kreuk's personality aside (I don't see how it has anything to do with the quality of the show, as actors are notoriously self absorbed, so I think the hit piece published above is irrelevant and I'm surprised it was approved) I find Kreuk's performance to be just the right combination of tough exterior with fragile insides. So far as the story is concerned, it's off to a bit of a slow start, but it's not uncommon for a good or even great show to take some time to build it's world. This will take a bit of time as the writers seem very focused on establishing the two main characters and their relationship to each other. I was also impressed that the action sequences did not dominate the show. They were short, well done and added to the story instead of hiding any flaws.

    "top_review": "I was surprised when I saw this show because WB has a reputation for churning out mindless, sleazy shows that don't add any value to television. 'Gilmore Girls' has to be the only quality show on WB and one of the few on television in general. It's about the relationship between a mother and daughter in a small town in Connecticut. Lorelai Gilmore had Rory when she was 16 and ran away from her uptight, old money parents to start her own life independently as a maid at an inn and then working her way up to general manager. Their relationship is more like a sister relationship than a parent-child relationship. The townspeople only add charm to the show.'Gilmore Girls' is an intelligent show with quick, witty dialogue that often refers to literature, music, movies, and pop culture. The characters talk extremely fast, which can be quite unrealistic sometimes when in a span of five seconds, two people can create comebacks for each other that contain references to Shakespeare and Madonna. But c'mon, it's just a show, and the point of the fast-paced dialogue and references is for the entertainment of audiences. We watch the show, hear the dialogue and laugh hard because we know what they're talking about. It's what makes 'The Simpsons' enjoyable, and the same can be applied to 'Gilmore Girls'. We know that such a quirky place as Stars Hollow most likely doesn't exist, but we watch it for the admiration for a dedicated single mother, hard-working daughter, and their minds that are abundant with intelligent and witty remarks about everything from Billy Bob Thornton to Bob Dylan.Give it a try. It's just one smart joke after another. Definitely not a typical WB show.",

Instead, I got a beautifully shot, smartly written, excellently acted, and a very \"high quality\" feel to everything. Dare I say it, but I get slight Breaking Bad vibes from the cinematography and just the overall feel of everything. For example, the use of the music at the end of the pilot episode and the opening segment of the second episode that seemed random and unrelated to the main plot at hand. That isn't to say it feels ripped off, because it's not. It actually feels fresh and exciting to watch. Compared to most other shows this summer (example, The Last Ship) this is superior in every way conceivable, unless of course you're looking for the good guys blowing up the bad guys. The second episode was just as impressive as the first. In fact, I actually watched it twice due to there being nothing else on TV. I never do that with anything.I sincerely hope WGN picks this up for another season. The fact that there are still under 500 votes on IMDb as of the second episode leave me a little worried about how the ratings fare.I guess the only thing the show could be doing better is having a better title sequence (think LOST, 24, Breaking Bad, etc. Just something simple but satisfying)!",

But to keep a story surprising and exciting while this main character is reliving this particular day would be difficult. And after seeing the first six episodes I was sure this was a good action/drama with a very interesting story. Because you got to see different angles to stories and characters. I couldn't wait till the next episode. Yes,maybe it was a bit far fetched. Only that was part of the fun. Also I liked the idea of getting the chance to correct mistakes you made. Who doesn't want that. What really was brilliant that they showed the different paths and their outcomes,good or bad. This gave the show a very intelligent take on faith and destiny. This show made you think and keep you entertained. In my book that is called a hit. That's why I am really sad to hear that they cancelled this great show! To me it's a big mystery that they keep on broadcasting boring shows like Law and Order and Stargate where they keep repeating the same themes over and over again and killing wonderful shows like this one. Thanks for this show,you made my day. Addendum: Good news!!!! ABC put out the remaining episodes from Day Break on their Website. I have been able to watch all the episodes! The finale was great!

    "critic_rating": "7.5", 
    "top_review": "Often times an actor or actress gets associated with an iconic role, a role they basically continue to play over and over, no matter what show or movie they're in. Happily, this is not the case for Patricia Heaton in her new show \"The Middle\". Her new character, while still a wife and mother of three, is much different than Debra Barone, the character she played for 9 years in \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\" In Debra, Heaton developed a character identified by her sharp, sarcastic wit, razor-sharp tongue, explosive temper, sexy appearance and a love-hate relationship with her husband and his family. Debra's problems were dealing with her passive-aggressive mother-in-law and her over-the-top intrusiveness, or the little \"moral superiority\" battles with Raymond. Because of this limited source for trouble and tension, the problems they had, while funny,were not down-to-earth, day-to-day problems most average families worry about.In Frankie, Heaton has created a character who is more of a mother than a wife, and is on the same level as her husband instead of above him. That makes a huge difference in the tone of the show, and it's quite refreshing. The problems this family faces are problems most families can identify with, from struggling with bills and worrying about work to having a kid who just can't seem to get it together and find his or her place in the world. Frankie doesn't have time to worry about who didn't put up a suitcase or to fake a boob job to prove some minor point; she has to work together with her whole family just to get by. They face each crisis together, and sometimes have to settle for a less than optimal solution. But at the end of the day, they love and support each other in sweet, often surprisingly tender ways.While not laugh out loud funny, the show has a sweetness and reality to it I find enjoyable. It has the same feel as old classic sitcoms from the 70's and early 80's, an era many consider to be the Golden Age of sitcom television. I think the biggest draw for me, though, is that I LIKE this family; I'd like to live next door to them, and get to know them. And really, can you say anything better about a show than that, that it makes a family so real and so genuine that you'd be happy to have them as neighbors? I hope the show continues and only gets better.",

I am a huge fan of the Daredevil comics, my favourite run being by Bendis and Maleev, and this show is how you would imagine a Daredevil TV show being. It's a dark, gritty sombre affair with some great action, there is a fight scene in episode two which is truly amazing.Talking about action the best part for me is the action feels very realistic and brutal unlike the Daredevil film with its over the top wire work. Also very good in this show is the way his powers aren't shown in any fancy way, no sonar view or anything like that, it just emphasise his listening. The actors are all great too and the plots are compelling, just now I have nothing bad to say about this show.When marvel got back the rights to Daredevil I was a little apprehensive of how they would portray his character, no worries there now I've seen it, or if they would use the character at all. I was worried if he did get his own show/film it'd be like the rest of the Marvel films/shows, light hearted action with great fan service and a good helping of comedic moments, which wouldn't of suited the dark world of Daredevil. But I can safely say to all you fellow hornhead fans that they have nailed everything about Daredevil perfectly.I would highly recommend this show to Daredevil fans and fans of darker heroes like Batman, fans of the current MCU films/shows might not like the tonal change from those films/shows but it's exactly what the character needed.

    "top_review": "The show's clever, the dialogue smart, the characters engaging and the the occasional veering into the absurd and outrageous provides a refreshing break from TV fare that is generally tepid at best these days.Yes, the characters may not all be nice and some may be nasty throughout the show, such as Tara Reid's cameo as J.D.'s slutty girlfriend. But they're always interesting, and the show's constantly funny. The love-hate relationship between Dr. Cox and Jordan is a pleasure to watch and keeping the J.D.-Elliot love/relationship off-kilter is a smart move on the writers' part.At a time when American TV audiences seem enraptured by garbage, such as \"Survivor,\" \"The Bachelor\" and \"Who Wants to Marry a Gold-Digging Slut/Hunk on a Deserted Island While Answering Questions With 19,000 Chances to Telephone Relatives and Friends for the Answers,\" NBC's \"Scrubs\" provides a breath of fresh air.It is the best sitcom on TV today and I only hope that NBC does right by this show and promotes it as much as it did the over-hyped \"Friends.\" Because \"Scrubs\" deserves all the promotion so that it can stick around for a long time.Addendum: The current season of \"Scrubs\" - where NBC runs two new episodes every Tuesday - is particularly good.This show gets absolutely no respect from its network and the show's creators, I think, believe this might very well be the last season. So they're pulling out all the stops and the lunacy is inspired, inventive and unquestionably funny. The remarkable thing about this show is that is so deftly balances wacky, wild humor - the non sequitur fantasy sequences are hilarious - with surprisingly moving and quiet moments.Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison and Judy Reyes have a wonderful sense of comic timing. And even though the series revolves around Braff's character, J.D., the show, I believe, belongs to John C. McGinley as Dr. Cox. His riffs are howlers and, yet, McGinley always finds the humanity in his character and the situations. And Dr. Cox's relationship with his wife, Jordan (Christa Miller, who is superb), is one of the series' highlights.I only wish the DVDs of the series would come out much sooner. \"Scrubs\" is one of the best sitcoms ever on TV and its 2006 season provides ample proof of that.",

The acting is good and the production values are excellent, as the crew did a superb job of bringing to life an alternate 1962 America. But perhaps Frank Spotnitz's greatest success is in his management of the source material, as his script remains pretty faithful to PKD's novel within the parameters of a 1-hour pilot. I would love to see Amazon make this a series, not only to see how Spotnitz and his team adapt the rest of the novel, but also to see where they might take it in seasons to come.",

    "top_review": "I was lucky enough to have a copy taped from BBC America (cheers, Mom!) -- if you're a Robson Green fan, it's a fantastic showcase for his acting. Not as cavalier as his \"Touching Evil\" series; his \"Wire in the Blood\" character of Tony Hill is much more reserved, quirky, and, being a criminal profiler, is more internalized with his processing of information. Even if you're not a Robson Green fan, this will surely garner him new followers. There were three full-length movies: \"The Mermaid's Singing\", \"Shadows Rising\", and \"Justice Painted Blind\". The first two, \"Singing\" and \"Shadows\" are adaptations of author Val McDermid's books;\"Justice\" is an original script based off of McDermid's work, but closely follows her style and she was directly involved with its creation, so I think it's a respectful homage to her work as a whole, so I don't think her fans will be disappointed. All three deal with strange and grisly serial killings, the profiling of possible suspects, and the drama involved with tracking down the unique killers. Set against the backdrop of the bleak, lonely hills of the north of England, the movies are all gritty and disturbing (but not overly-so), and they really show the darker side of human nature and the lengths at which a profiler like Tony Hill is willing to venture to capture the killer. The supporting cast is brilliant; Hermione Norris as D.I. Carol Jordan is just wonderful to watch. Intelligent, sincere, and admirably professional, it's as much her story as it is Tony Hill's. The chemistry they have is marvellous to watch and not at all contrived. Personally, I think \"Mermaids\" was the best; it was the first, it clearly had the most detailed characterizations and plot complexity, and was definitely the most vicious -- some scenes definitely not for the faint of heart. But still compelling and highly recommended. The other two are still great, well-plotted and suspenseful, but slightly less edgy as the first. I recommend seeing the series in its proper order, to catch little references to past storylines.",

    "critic_rating": "8.2", 
    "top_review": "Lighten up: Looking is not a documentary and its characters may not be instantly relatable (or even terribly likable). But those are not necessarily shortcomings. Viewers who relax and just let the show unfold will find they'll enjoy it more than if they spend every moment trying to find themselves on screen or divine some higher purpose from watching it. It's well known that in gay online culture, \"looking\" means \"I'm available for sex - now.\" Here, however, it means so much more.These characters are really looking for fulfillment: through relationships, careers, self-expression, entrepreneurship, family and friendship. (Oh, yeah -- if that hot guy over there is down to play, so are they). But hooking up is not the central theme of this show despite the sexy come-on of the title.This show is not Queer as Folk, Part II. While QaF's characters spent a lot of time wringing their hands over equality, acceptance and pride, Looking's whole approach to being gay has matured along with society and the audience. These characters are fully realized, assimilated and don't dwell on whether society accepts them. The men of Looking are just too busy fiddling with their smart phones (cruising Grindr or Scruff, perhaps?) to waste any time navel-gazing over their sexual orientation. There's a post-gay sensibility about these characters (Yup; I'm a homo - so, what?) that is very refreshing. QaF often just waved a rainbow flag when its stories ran out of steam. Don't expect that to happen here. Looking also avoids a pitfall about which gays have long griped: the over-use of stereotypical, \"fem-acting\" gay characters. Looking's guys range from pretty masculine to downright butch. Finally, here's a show that celebrates the fact that intimacy between men can be a hyper-masculine experience and deserves to be showcased as such. These dudes just enjoy getting frisky with other dudes. There's nothing sissy 'bout that.It's also refreshing to see characters of different ages relating socially even though some might say this happens infrequently in the real world. Older characters may sheepishly refer to the \"old days\" while the younger characters pretend not to notice that their friends are, well, older.As the series unfolds, I hope the show will explore inter-generational dating, open relationships, monogamy, celibacy, and also how many of these things can also take place within a marriage. I also hope it will delve into the still-surprising \"ordinariness\" of what it is to be gay today, especially in a major city. Despite the good word of mouth, leading a gay life can often be less than fabulous. There's a fair amount of slogging away at work, paying taxes, taking out the trash, tending to family and mowing the lawn. Just ask around.It would be easy to pigeonhole this as a \"gay\" show, but I hope heterosexual viewers will fall in love with its quirky characters and insights. They'll discover that whether gay or straight, we're all more alike than many of us realize: People are generally horny, driven to succeed and need to feel loved. In short, we're all Looking.",

He doesn't engage very well with guests on the show; the silly games are not a substitute for either serious or comic interaction with those appearing on the show. He might consider letting some of his accomplished guests, Seinfeld for example, do a comedy bit on their own. Also agree that the band doesn't add much to the show; would be better just to have higher quality musical guests and have them do two performances as on SNL. Bottom line Comedy has a lot of staying power but silly gets old in a hurry;Fallon doesn't seem to know the difference between comedy and silly. At the end of the day (haha - get it?!), Jimmy seems to have succumbed to the same problem that plagues SNL; maybe he spent too much time there - take a one-time clever and humorous idea and then repeat it over and over until viewers are sick of it.",

This was not the case with Finding Carter. The characters portrayed are complex and conflicted, nevertheless I found myself able to empathise with every character on the show, maybe not sympathising with their behaviour, but definitely understanding it.The premise guarantees interesting character interaction, as well as diametrically different points of view that situations can be looked at. It is difficult to achieve believability when trying to show this on screen, but this show managed to do this quite well.The acting was surprisingly decent, especially from the main lead and the Wilson family. I say surprisingly, because more often than not, in features involving a young cast, acting is a problem. Alex Saxon and Jesse Henderson as the male love interests, were far from good in my opinion, but overall the cast was doing a fine job; even the little brother was believable, which could have been the biggest worry.Even though I initially watched it because of my younger sister, I still look forward to the next episode. Especially the subtle hint, that there is more to the whole kidnapping story, keeps me interested. I hope the show keeps up the realism, despite the complex premise.",

    "top_review": "A lot of reviews here have really derided this show for being completely unrealistic, cheesy, and boring, and have basically labeled it \"Grey's Anatomy in Space.\" I highly disagree. I address some of the concerns below:1) Some reviews make the problem with the show one of being unrealistic. First off, IT'S A SCIENCE FICTION SHOW SET IN THE FUTURE. Who is really worrying about realism? And if you are, how can you worry about what's realistic when we have absolutely no way of knowing what is real IN THE FUTURE? Plus, it's simply TV...if you want realism, watch the discovery channel, or go visit Cape Canaveral in Florida, don't come looking for it on a show on ABC.2) One previous review comments about the female Hispanic astronaut attempting to teach in space via video communication, and how she switched in and out of Spanish when talking. I kind of got offended at that review, as they said that she was simply making up random, nonsense words in Spanish when talking. I'm a native Spanish speaker, and all of what she was saying made complete sense. Second, why is the concept of multilingual teaching so hard to accept? The show is set 41 years in the future, and at the rate Hispanics are growing in this country, Spanish is fast becoming a critical secondary language in the US. Not to mention, various educational programs via the internet are doing the same thing, so it is far from nonsensical. It's simply a very bigoted view.3) Before making assumptions about the show, or passing judgment on it, watch the episodes available from start to finish. Many concerns about plot holes are addressed in subtle ways that someone not taking any effort to pay attention to the show, and instead use it as mindless background noise, would definitely miss. 4) Yes, I understand the whole \"why is there a music video in the middle of the show\" concern. There are a couple of points where the show uses a musical \"interlude\" during emotional/emotion-evoking scenes. The question is, how else would you like them to show the love between a husband and wife, or the thrill of beginning space exploration? By talking about it? By cheesy dialog between the characters trying to say something of deep meaning, but not succeeding? Please. The show tried to appease individuals looking for that sort of thing by the whole \"astronaut video diary\" scenes. By the way, the scenes in question are about 6-7 minutes out of a 45 minute show. Get over it.5) This isn't Star Trek. It isn't Star Wars. It isn't your typical science fiction set really far in the future, where anything and everything is possible. It's a show about what space exploration COULD BE like sometime in the next half century, but that doesn't mean that it's how things WILL be. People who have problems with this seem to think that space travel is either via Space Shuttle, or by the Starship Enterprise, and nothing in between. Keep your mind open.It's a nice change of pace from medical drama shows, legal/police drama shows, \"teen angst\" shows, and family comedies. It's something a bit different. Plus, only two episodes have aired (both of which were pretty good when you simply sat back and enjoyed it for what it was worth, rather than trying to nit-pick apart the show for every little thing). There's plenty of the show ahead, so give it some time. Plot lines take time to develop and get better.Obviously, not everyone likes every show. I know that there are definitely shows that I've despised through the years, and I'm sure everyone has their own shows that they feel that way about. All I'm saying is, watch the show, give it a chance, and allow it to be its own show, not something else that it's not, but that you or someone else would like it to be because you were comfortable with the previous show. Additionally, Ron Livingston is the man, so there's always that.",

    "top_review": "To comment on classicalsteve from Oakland, CA's post. The most important point was, as with ANY business situation. : Do your homework on current market values! I don't think in the case of Pawn stars that these guys necessarily make an offer based on what YOU think you should get for it, but rather, what they think or know they can get for the item. No different than any other wholesale to retail business.Although there are similarities to antique roadshow, these guys are offering INSTANT CASH in most cases. When they are unsure of an items value, they bring in experts in their field, and they do it while the customer is there. It is funny when the expert says an item is worth 3000 retail and then the customer expects 3000. As Rick says over and over, I can't stay in business paying retail.As to Steve's comments on collectibles; I don't think they are making 10x what an item is worth. Anyone that stupid to sell so cheaply deserves to get hammered in my opinion. If you are a collector, then you should be doing your own homework on channels to sell through, and there are plenty of them. If you feel your best option is to sell to a pawn broker, then what would you be expecting? Steve, I'd like to know in your opinion, what exactly the value of \"culture\" is, as you state in your post. They are pawn brokers. That's what the show is about. Your post suggests that the SELLERS of the items are not interested in the money, which is clearly not the case. Every single person is most interested in what they can get for their item. And I also don't agree with your assessment of \"the poor seller at their mercy due to lack of knowledge.\" Knowledge is something that can be acquired, and sellers should obviously have acquired some concerning their items value before entering the arena of buying and selling. Also how could they tell the buyer what they intend to resell the item for when they really never KNOW what they're going to get. Market forces are constantly at work. Personally I think you paint a picture here that these guys are crooks, when in reality, this is business as usual. Buy low, sell high. You are clearly not a businessman. The interaction between the characters is highly entertaining, and somewhat informative as well.Mike",

The show's concept is relatively simple: a secret agency composed of ten year-olds fights evil adults; the result is a imaginative world that is both inspired by several genres and movies and creates a distinct universe. The comedy is wide-ranging in the ages it appeals to, the action is entertaining despite the show not being the pinnacle of animation, and the plots are original while paying homage to it's sources: many of the episodes are homages with a KND spin that works extremely well. The characters that make up this rich universes might seem like stereotypes at first, but they grow into completely three-dimensional beings that can be both fun and poignant.Hands down, KND is one of the best original shows on Cartoon Network, keeping with the explosion of comic creativity in the channel that is leagues ahead of most other kid-oriented channels (Nick and Disney come to mind).",

    "critic_rating": "8.6", 
    "top_review": "Well, we've had to be patient for nearly a quarter of a century to finally see Ash wield his chainsaw again, but trust me: it was well worth the wait. Ash vs. Evil Dead fires on all cylinders.After so many years had passed since Army of Darkness (aka Evil Dead III) came out in 1992, it looked like a direct sequel just wasn't going to happen anymore, yet apparently, the Raimi-Campbell gang had been working on one for some time. According to recent interviews with the show's creators Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, what was first supposed to be a new feature film and the fourth entry in the franchise, over time turned into an idea for a TV-series, and I believe fans will be very happy with the result. Instead of a 2-hour film for a sequel, we now get 5 more hours with Ash and the Deadites (possibly more if the show's going to be a success) and judging from what I've seen so far, those 5 hours are going to be an absolute blast.(This paragraph contains some \u0096 very \u0096 mild spoilers; there won't be any in the rest of this review). At the beginning of the show we meet Ash leading a lazy, but apparently happy slacker life, residing in a run-down trailer and working as a stock boy at a Value Stop (for some obscure legal reasons, the writers couldn't use the name S-Mart from Army of Darkness' iconic last scene). In the show, 30 years have passed since Ash's last encounter with the Deadites, and while he might be well into middle age now, he hasn't matured one bit. Ash is still the exact same guy we last saw fighting walking skeletons and other ghastly undead things in Army of Darkness, cracking wise and appearing as cock-sure of himself as ever (despite still not being the \"smartest cookie in the jar\" - to put it mildly). These days, he likes to spend most of his spare time either getting wasted in his trailer or picking up random ladies - or both (mostly both). I won't go further into any of the story details (because that would only spoil the fun); suffice to say that his rather irresponsible lifestyle ultimately won't go too well with his duty as keeper of a certain (slightly) dangerous book, and (very!) bloody mayhem soon ensues.In my opinion, Ash vs. Evil Dead does everything right. Instead of going down the \"gritty drama\" route of shows like The Walking Dead or taking the \"straight horror\" approach of Fede Alvarez' Evil Dead remake, creators Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell fully embrace the over-the-top goofiness and playful tone of Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, while still delivering the scares of the first film and plenty (and I mean: PLENTY) of gore. The Deadites are frightening, but they're also kind of comical in that they don't look too realistic (don't get me wrong, their make-up is gorgeous, but they don't look like the zombies from George A. Romero's films or The Walking Dead). The production values in general are absolutely great; the writing is in the vein of the first three films (no wonder, since the episodes were mostly written by Sam and Ivan Raimi); the music, the pacing and the direction: really everything just falls into place. It's clear that this wasn't some lazy attempt to cash in on the name of a beloved cult-franchise, but a labour of love for all involved.Another great plus of the series is the cast. Seeing Bruce Campbell step back into this iconic character is simply hilarious fun; it still fits him like a glove (or, perhaps more accurately in his case, a chainsaw). But there was never a doubt in my mind that he would deliver (it seems Ash is a character Campbell was born to play); what really surprised me was how well the rest of the cast fits into the show. Ray Santiago as Pablo and Dana DeLorenzo as Kelly (they're Ash's co-workers at the Value Stop) are completely able to hold their own; they are fully fleshed-out characters and just as fun to watch as Ash.So my verdict: Ash vs Evil dead brings back everything that I loved about the original Evil Dead films, but it also manages to introduce interesting new characters and story lines which help maintain the element of surprise for long-time fans. And the show works just as well as a stand-alone story, so people unfamiliar with the original trilogy need not worry either: they will find just as much to love here as those who know and cherish Sam Raimi's classics - as long as they have a certain affection for trashy, gory horror comedies and don't expect serious drama (Six Feet Under this is not). In my book, this show is already a winner: 8 stars out of 10.ASH IS BACK: HAIL TO THE KING, BABY, AND HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

The scenes were spectacular and the plots where well knitted in most of the episodes.  I liked the attention to detail and the ability for it to be fairly believable, despite the fictional capability of Airwolf. The characters complimented each other and made the show very dynamic. Even the music created by S. Levay was really good. It is very unfortunate that the series ended the way it did.  Jan M. Vincent had problems with alcohol and the politics with universal infringed on Bellisario's ideas.  The \"lady\" did not go down with a blaze of glory but rather an un-answered and open ended destruction with the final series. I think that is why so many enthusiast still hang on to Airwolf, it was a killer show that just suddenly ended, even though the ratings were so high. It would be cool to have a new movie produced to give Airwolf a final resting place in T.V. history. But that is unlikely. However, there are all kinds of fan clubs and sites that celebrate this one of a kind 80's show, you will see that Airwolf is very much alive out on the internet.  C.L.",

    "top_review": "I am at a lost for words at how ONE vote of ONE can bring down the rating on this show so much! I've seen how many people absolutely adore this show, and I'm one of them. The show definitely deserves a better rating and definitely a better glance. I've watched this show for about 11 years now (I'm 17 now), and I'm still absolutely attached. Of course when I first watched, it was the DiC English dubbed version. Curiosity got the better of me though, and to this date I've seen 85% of the Japanese episodes. It's really a shame how this show was butchered when it was dubbed, and how so many people still dismiss this show as a \"kid's show\". Sailor Moon is so much more though. It's relatable in a lot of ways, like self consciousness and relationship problems, and it covers a lot of issues, such as homosexuality, sexuality in general, violence, etc. there's even swearing for goodness sake. I wouldn't really consider those \"kid's show qualities\". Not only is it relatable though, it's got so many positive ends. It's HILARIOUS (EVERY character has their moment), the dialogue is great, it's absolutely touching at points, and it's just incredibly feel good. And in my most humble opinion, the characters are so easy to love and relate to. You've got the hugest klutz with a heart of gold, Usagi. You've Ami, the genius with a sweet disposition. You've got Rei, a firey but sincere friend. You've got Mako-chan, the tough-on-the-outside-but-feminine tomboy. You've got Minako, the loyal but ditzy soldier. Mamoru, who is Tuxedo Mask, absolutely HOT. Then you've got the talking cats, Luna and Artemis. And those are the very main characters.What I also love about Sailor Moon is how unique it is, and how it doesn't exactly follow a specific formula like a lot of other shows do. It seems simple, girl with magic powers kills monsters and saves the day. It's got a million subplots though that make you want to keep watching. And every season is a new villain, so you don't get bored, and it can also suit whatever mood you're in.And also, it doesn't hurt that the music is dead on catchy. I've had some of the transformation music stuck in my head for days. And wow, I've just been going on for a very long time haven't I? I guess that's my review then. Sailor Moon IS an AMAZING show, so before all you Sailor Moon haters who've only ever seen the dub version of Sailor Moon give this show a rating out of one (*COUGH*), I recommend that you watch it a bit of it in Japanese first, and then come back and vote. You might change your mind. ;) If not, then well, hopefully it'll still be higher than a one. ;) I've turned some of my friends over when they watched it in Japanese. :PSo yeah, Sailor Moon is an AMAZING, HILARIOUS and ADDICTIVE show. Honestly don't miss out on it, and don't judge is so quickly. You might love it if you gave it a chance. ;)Definitely 10/10.",

So I followed the build-up and got more and more excited as the time neared for the show's premiere. And it was worth it! Firstly; The show is different than the movies, but what did you expect? Yea, it got inspiration from the source material but it stands on it's own. Secondly; don't mind the clich\u00e9s, they're meant to be there. Overall this is a fun comedy-horror/mystery with all the horror clich\u00e9s in the book, you love to see someone die because they're stupid! Even the characters are clich\u00e9s; There are the Jocks (popular douche bags), nerds (or in this case horror fans), and of course you have the virgins (or good girls). So have fun trying to guess who the killer is, I know I will.",

The hero is given a diary which can predict the future, and is thrown into a battle with 11 others where the last survivor becomes God.This anime is different in that the main character is not equipped to handle the situation at all. In most shows, anime or otherwise, they never throw at the hero more than s/he can handle, no matter how ill equipped they seem at first. The hero here has no natural talent, nor is he given time to explore his power. From the start he is thrown into survival mode and makes most choices out of desperation, and even though it seems for a while in the middle of the show he has a handle on everything, he loses his grip and inevitably digs himself into a hole he can't climb out of.The characters are insane, and the relationships they develop are even more so. The appeal is watching a character trying to be moral in a situation where doing so gets you killed and starting to hate him for it. It's seeing him slowly but surely lose his moral compass and become just another contestant, and watching him regret it later. It's fighting the urge to shout \"you moron!\" as he falls deeper into a toxic relationship and yet empathizing with him.This show is absolutely insane, and I love it.",

There seems to be an overwhelming sense of animosity toward this show.In a world where HOT IN CLEVELAND is a hit, it makes me sad that so many people don't seem to appreciate the nuance and detail that have gone into this show. There are some reviews here that don't even make much sense.They're just plain angry. (One review actually criticized the hair color of one of the actors!) I say, relax people. If you don't find it to your liking don't watch. But for those of us that do, (it's already a hit in the UK as well as on SHOWTIME) it is a subtle and sophisticated pleasure that doesn't pander to it's audience. This show is about a married couple and their relationship. It's set in the world of television but the TV aspect is secondary. I hadn't seen the two British leads before but I totally love their chemistry. It feels much more honest than most TV relationships. Both actors are subtle and complicated and I can totally buy the fact that they're married. I thought the first episode did exactly what it had to do which is introduce a whole lot of characters plus set up this couple's journey. As for not being funny, I am at a complete loss. John Pankow established \"Merc Lapides\" in twenty seconds. How could you not laugh at his references to his bigoted New Jersey grandmother, his alcohol addiction, his cancer? And \"Carol Rance\", the network exec, made me laugh at just about everything she said. Ditto the head of comedy who with just a few grimaces and groans created a hysterical and memorable character. I feel that this is not a show for the masses. It was clearly never meant to be. It's a small gem of a show that respects it's audience and has it's own very unique voice.

    "top_review": "The first thing I noticed about this version of TMNT is the fact than none of the heroes in the halfshell had any pupils.  To me, no pupils=no souls, just like the characters in that darkened Turtles revamp in the mid-nineties which misstepped and almost spelled the end for the series.But I sat through a couple of episodes and was came back VERY satisfied with the new version.I grew up watching the lean, green fighting machines fight a bunch of bumbling and stumbling bad guys, robots, aliens, mutants, oftentimes saving April O'Neill in the nick of times while ending each productive day eating pizza with some gnarly toppings (chocolate chips and anchovies, anyone?) Slapstick humor, groaner puns, and fast-paced action fortified with blood-pumping music was the order of the day, and we all seemed to like it just fine, thanyouverymuch. I still get a kick out of those episodes when I break out the old tapes.Now, with the original comic book writer Peter Laird providing input, we have a much more serious tone. This time our heroes aren't here to solve Scooby-Doo mysteries and make pizza jokes.  This series actually chronicles their day-to-day lives as they live in their underground lair with Master Splinter. The reason they live in the sewers (which should have been obvious) has been really played up this time: they are freaks, monsters. The fact that they are outcasts makes solving various crimes and getting on the six-o-clock news with April O'Neill a pretty difficult thing to accomplish (besides the fact that April is now a former lab assistant and not a news reporter as in the earlier incarnations).So all their lives the four turtles have been honing their ninjitzu skills under their sensei, when their lives have been turned upside down by the arrival of Shredder, Splinter's arch-nemesis. The other reviewers are right, Bebob and Rocksteady would not have lasted a second under this Shredder. To take him lightly is to dig your own grave. The turtle's struggle to return to their normal lives during their confrontations with Shredder is the running drama binding these new episodes (which helps keep me interested every week since this time I know there will be a climax, instead of hearing \"You miserable turtles, I'll get you next time!\" after every other unrequited episode in the old series.)Despite all this, I still would have been bored with this series if the turtles acted as serious as they looked. But to my relief, they retained much of their old personalities of the old series. Leonardo is still the leader, Donatello's still the inventive brain, Raphael is still sarcastic (and this time gruff and tough), and Michaelangelo is, well, you all know Mikey. I do really believe Mike's even more outrageous in this series than in the old one. Because they still retained their personalities, they don't come off as robotic Warriors of Virtue but as \"regular\" teens who find themselves caught in a bad space of time.The way the series uses split screens, wide screens, more kick-butt action (screw the Parent Advisory Council!) and took its stories seriously also doesn't hurt the appeal. Add to this the humanity of the characters, and you have yourself a superior product on your hands.**** out of four stars.",

    "critic_rating": "8.0", 
    "top_review": "Dexter's Lab is one of Cartoon Network's best shows ever. I saw this as far back as when the pilot debuted in February 1995 on The World Premiere Toon Show (later known as The What a Cartoon Show, now The Cartoon Cartoon Show), and I remember seeing the series premiere on TNT in April 1996 (back when CN's shows were being shared on TNT & TBS). At the time the cartooning industry was making a comeback, this was one of Cartoon Network's best programs ever.Dexter is a boy-genius who lives in the depths of suburbia, and often works in his secret laboratory (pretty big place for such a small house). But his quest for ultimate knowledge (on par with Einstein, Newton, etc.) is often squandered by his sometimes annoying sister, Dee Dee. Other characters include Mom & Dad (no real names, thus no last name for the family), Mandark (Dexter's worst enemy), plus Mee Mee and Lee Lee (Dee Dee's friends), and several more.There are two sub-cartoons to this series. The first was Dial \"M\" for Monkey, a cartoon about Dexter's lab monkey, who's actually a superhero (unknown to Dexter) who saves the world from intergalactic villains. The second (and better) sub-toon is The Justice Friends. It was a cartoon about three (of total eight) superheroes living together. They were Major Glory, Valhallen, and Krunk. Both of these sub-toon were funny and cool, but I think The Justice Friends was better.Back to Dexter's Lab, it marked the start of this \"Cal-Arts\" style, in where, unlike previous Cal-Arts graduates, the artists create cartoons with UPA-esque drawings (most of which are okay on their own level), mixed with emotionally compelling stories, complete with endless action movie spoofs. All thanks to Genndy Tartakovsky's brilliant supervision, and the excellent artwork of Craig McCracken & Paul Rudish. I think this show was at its best between late 1996 and late 1997, in where its art, writing, and humor was at its peak.However, Dexter's Lab joins the list of several cartoons with a waning franchise. Its original run was from 1996 to 1998, but its new run began in November 2001.Tartakovsky is now the executive producer, with Chris Savino now running the show. Sorry to say, but Savino is a better artist than director. These new episodes have some of the cheapest designs; unlike the older episodes, they actually look as if they've been cribbed from Kindergarden drawings! David Smith is Chris Savino's unofficial assistant, but he also makes a better artist than art director. Sorry, but even for a beginner, his designs are terrible. Plus, aside from the major character re-designs, a lot of the minor character designs are horrible. Smith has just recently been replaced by Paul Stec, whose designs are better, but not as good as the likes of McCracken or Rudish. The stories are mostly reworks of much of the classic episodes, and the jokes are few and far between. And the sub-cartoons are, if ever seldom mentioned. But some of them thankfully pick up on several concepts originally left untouched in the classic series. Dexter's Lab had a TV movie released in December 1999, which was fine, except that its artistic quality could've/should've been better. Overall, Dexter's Lab joins Rugrats and Johnny Bravo in the list in where a cartoon had a solid run, but made an unnecessary revival, which ruins the franchise on a whole. To be fair, the new episodes did cover some lost concepts (as I said earlier). But the generally stellar material of the older episodes is sadly missing in the new Dexter's Lab episodes. Probably because most of the original artists are hard at work on the series' sister toon, The Powerpuff Girls.The new episodes are weakening what was once a clean production. But I still enjoy watching the classic episodes of Dexter's Laboratory.",

This was a primetime series, hence the slightly-adult humor from time to time. One way Top Cat and the cats always try to make a buck is by fleecing people (especially tourists) in various different creative ways. They even try to set up gambling, as Dibble once caught Top Cat with a roulette wheel! They even like to bet on the horses (Spook: \"Hey TC, like when are we going to the track?\" Top Cat: \"As soon as we raise the two bucks for a bet!\").The dynamic between Dibble and the cats is often exhibited in many ways, because really Dibble doesn't actually want to run them in the slammer. Dibble even narrated the beginning of one episode explaining the delicate balance of his beat, it being \"non-scientific\" but he keeps that balance. And his unique relationship with TC and the others is a big part of that balance.So far only one episode (to my knowledge) has been released on DVD, on a cartoon compilation release.

    "critic_rating": "8.3", 
    "top_review": "In a way, BBC's The Last Kingdom is a first ever experience for me. It's certainly not the first series I watch, nor it's the first series based on books, not even historical fiction books. But it's the first series which I'd read the books it is based on way before it was even announced. So seeing it rumored, then officially announced and finally premiered was very interesting and exciting. I had a lot of hopes and fears for this. And I'm so gladly to say that based on the first two episodes of the series, my hopes were made into reality and my fears into joy. And so, inspired me to write my first review here.I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but some are impossible to avoid.The Last Kingdom tells the history of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, a Saxon noble who is captured and raised by the Danes, first as a slave and then as a son. His future will be one of battle within and without, fighting against powerful warlords and struggling between his love for the Danes and their culture and his duty for the Saxons.In many ways, talking about how this series make this simple enough premise into a engrossing story full of nuance is talking about how the books do it. Here there is a commitment to reality that goes beyond most historical shows, and I'm not talking only about the clothes, weapons or history itself, but characters, their motives and relationships. At the center of The Last Kingdom is its characters and the show presents and develops then masterfully. Take \u00c6lfric (Joseph Millson) for example, Uhtred's uncle. When the young Uhtred (Tom Taylor) wakes up and realize his father went to war without him, he promptly go and ask him why he was left behind. His uncle barely talks to him and say he has to go and clear the stables. But the directing and acting in the scene makes it clear \u00c6lfric has something sinister in mind. Uhtred get his pony and goes to join his father, and then you realize that that was \u00c6lfric's plan all along. It's subtle and skillfully done, and with something that feel effortless you have a lot shown to you what \u00c6lfric is all about. When it comes to characters there is no compromise, they feel like real people that are just living their lives. Doing what they think is right and/or what is best for them and their loved ones. You won't find good or bad here, nor one dimensional characters. By the end of the first episode, you will find you will have feeling for these people, both positive and negative. And in the end, that is what keeps you interesting in a series. And you will care for the fate of Uhtred (Alexander Dreymon), Brida (Emily Cox), Alfred (David Dawson) and the many other great characters that are present in the first two episodes.And from them stem all the other conflicts in the series. The political plotting and machinations are ever present in the fractured world that these people inhabit, and the leaders of both the Saxons and Danes are constantly trying to get things working in their favor. Together with political issues, there is religion. Christianity is a defining characteristic of the English, and because of the Norse paganism, they view the Danes not only as enemy of the Saxons, by enemies of God. The Danes of the other hand, view Christianity with a disinterested curiosity. In one opportunity Uhtred explain Heaven as Valhalla without all the drinking, fighting and humping. This passage helps to illustrate a kind of 'lightness' that the series, just as the books, have. Maybe lightness is not the best word, since there is plenty of violence and moments that will leave you shocked, but the story is told in a way that feels amiable and pleasant. That is done is the series by skillful directing , writing (in the first two episodes done by Nick Murphy and Stephen Butchard respectively) and editing. That, along with its character, might be the two most appealing things about The Last Kingdom.Add to that a great score, beautiful scenery and great acting (although a little bit inconsistent in some moments) and you have the recipes for a series that stand tall and deserves to be seen. No matter what you like, The Last Kingdom (the first two episodes together are a nice demonstration of everything good about this story) might offer something for you.For the books fan in particular, this is a series that even when it changes the story of the book it feels it belong, Bernard Cornwell's tone is ever present in it. Not to mention many small moments that shows the people responsible for the series really cared about the source material, like in shield wall battle (it doesn't reach the greatness of the book, but then, what battle scene anywhere does?), there is a scene of people walking over a dead body, something that feels taken right from the book. Or a sword strike that comes from bellow. Even some of the more questionable changes feel justified. Like giving the Saxon rectangular shields. In the end it proves extremely valuable as a tool to differentiate Danes from Saxons. But without a doubt, this is a adaptation that work is all levels and will delight most readers.",

    "top_review": "Ten years after Emmerich & Devlin showed the world how it SHOULD be done, the TV spin off of their (still) greatest achievement has finally proven itself to be the best franchise in existence today.For those unfamiliar with the original film, the Stargate is a device found buried in the Giza plateau of Egypt in 1928. In 1994 (or 1996, if you follow the chronology of the series) the United States Air force has come into possession of the gate and recruits radical Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (then played by James Spader) to translate the runes found alongside it and activate the gate.Sure enough, Jackson opens the gate and a reconnaissance team led by the stoic Colonel Jack O'Neil (a dour-faced Kurt Russell) is assigned to survey the world on the other side, later to be known as Abydos. Jackson too, is sent along with the goal of reopening the gate on the other side. Once on the other side though, the team come across a civilisation being ruled over by the mythical god Ra and come to discover the truth behind both the Abydonians and the Ancient Egyptians -  that thousands of years ago a dying alien parasite came to Earth and took a host in the form of a primitive human boy (Jaye Davidson). Using his advanced technology, the alien - now in human form - masqueraded as the god Ra, conquering the planet and using the Stargate to transport thousands of humans to Abydos to mine the minerals needed to sustain his technology.Needless to say, O'Neil and Jackson see to it that the Abydonians are shown the truth about their god and rebel against him. Jackson stays behind on Abydos with his new wife Sha'uri (later changed to Share) and O'Neil's team returns to Earth.The series picks up one year later, when the now dormant Stargate is reactivated unexpectedly and a hostile alien force seemingly under the leadership of Ra launches an attack on the base, taking a hostage in the process. In response, the base's new CO, General George Hammond (the superb Don S. Davis) calls on the now-retired Jack O'Neill (who, as well an extra 'L' in his name, has also become the much-lighter Richard Dean Anderson) to lead his team back to Abydos and determine the nature of this new threat. Back on Abydos however, Daniel Jackson (now played to perfection by Michael Shanks) shows O'Neill and scientist Captain (later Major) Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) that the Stargate can evidently open doorways to more planets than simply Abydos and that whoever attacked Earth did not originate from Abydos.The situation becomes more critical though, when the same force attacks Abydos and both Share and her brother Ska'ra are taken. Jackson immediately returns to Earth, where the President authorises the creation of nine teams to uncover what lies through the Stargate on each different world - O'Neill's team (including Jackson and Carter) being designated SG-1.Following the Stargate address seen during the attack on Abydos, SG-1 travel to a planet known as Chulak where they discover the true origin of the enemy force - another alien masquerading as a god, this time as the god Apophis. The situation worsens when both Share and Ska'ra are revealed to have become hosts to the aliens, known as the Goa'uld. Imprisoned on Chulak, SG-1 must rely on Apophis' head guard when he turns traitor and agrees to help the team escape. The alien, Teal'c (the impeccable Christopher Judge), leads the team to the Stargate, all the while fighting a bloody battle in an attempt to recover Share and Ska'ra.After the rather breakneck pilot, season 1 of SG-1 falls into a rather repetitive pattern pretty quickly - the team shows up at a planet looking for advanced technology to fight the Goa'uld, stumbles across a problem with either the locals or said technology and spends the rest of the episode solving that problem. Although the episodes aren't really that lacklustre, they do serve to remind you that the Star Trek franchise has existed for years on pretty much the same recurring `planet of the week' plot. It's not until the season's final three episodes that the show shows even any sign of promise.The season closing trilogy however, rejuvenate the series back to the strong form it displayed in the pilot, when Apophis finally launches his ships against Earth and SG-1 alone must prevent the planet's destruction. Although the story is concluded in the second season premiere, the main plotline picks up tremendously from there. By two-thirds of the way through it's sophomore season Apophis is gone and the scope of the show is revealed - there was never only two aliens to fight, there are in fight a large group - all masquerading as gods - known as the System Lords.The show from then on deals largely with defending Earth against these enemies, although at the midway point in season three Apophis returns as the series' biggest foe and takes much of the play until the season four/five two-parter. It is in Apophis' aftermath that a new foe is revealed : Anubis. Once a powerful and sadistic Goa'uld System Lord, Anubis was banished when even the other Goa'ulds objected to his activates.Mastering the technology of the Stargate builders (known as the Ancients), Anubis takes the tension to a whole new level when - by the close of season seven - he shows up in orbit of Earth with an armada waiting to destroy the planet.The beauty of the series is simple : it never slumps unrecoverably. In every instance of a slightly dull episode, the following episode will undoubtedly show itself to be one of the best pieces of television you'll ever see. On a story-arc level alone, the series beats genre shows like Deep Space Nine and The X-Files hands-down almost simply because the arc stays consistent, there are no ludicrous changes of pace, no unexplained leaps that need to be taken and no confusion over the eventual direction of the story.The evolution of the show is also a high point. By season six, technology recovered in the preceding seasons have been mastered and put into practical use. Characters show bonds that grow with time, even enemies become fleshed out and changed allegiances (for the first time I can remember on television) are actually plausible.The two biggest selling points of SG-1 are it's writing and it's performances. In Anderson, the show has a leading man that fits every bill perfectly. The character - although admittedly a big leap from Russell's performance - grows incredibly to the point where every nuance is golden. In the confines of the Stargate universe, O'Neill has basically two roles - comedian and action hero, both of which are superbly portrayed. Shanks begins the series by essentially playing Spader playing Jackson and then evolving the character to the point that you forget Spader ever filled the role in the first place. Tapping - although irritating as hell in the initial episodes - eventually becomes intensely loveable, mainly serving as both the frustrated emotional core of the team and the brains of the outfit coming up with a plan for every alien threat that comes their way. Judgeis also spot-on, taking the kind of stoicism earmarked by Michael Dorn for all those years  and graduating it to a level of pure awe. Teal'c is a character that in the hands of an other actor could have been a disaster, but with Judge you actually find yourself revelling in the character's highs and lows as much as he himself does. Obviously the character fills the role of the team's muscle, but his level of comic relief is superb - not just on a level of writing, but also on a level of deadpan and delivery.This show launches it's first real spin off in July (US) and September (UK) in Stargate : Atlantis, and with a proposed movie on the horizon the future is looking rosy. Above all, this is a franchise that deserves it's endurance and widespread appeal.",

All signs point to the fact that this is a map of many Stargates that exist throughout the galaxy - a development that makes the dream of the SG-1 team to travel throughout the universe in time a reality.",

    "top_review": "I had read about \"Detective Conan\" about a year prior to the show being released in the United States, and so when \"Case Closed\" began airing in May of 2004 I jumped at the opportunity to see this show. I was not disappointed.This show is a welcome relief from the Scooby-Doo inspired cartoons (not to mention Scooby-Doo itself) that presented a \"mystery\" that a tree slug could solve in two minutes. The stories are well thought out, the solutions are NOT obvious but can be put together by an observant (and thinking) viewer, just as Conan does, and best of all the series does not insult the intelligence of its viewers: the show is entertaining without padding 3/4 or the episode with slapstick routines and mindless running from a person in a Halloween costume.The show's premise is that little six-year-old Conan Edogawa is actually a 16-year-old detective prodigy. He was reduced to a grade school child when a mysterious would-be assassin gave him an experimental poison that (unknown to the poisoner) regressed the detective rather than killing him. In a bit of angst reminiscent of the early adventures of \"Spider-Man\", Conan makes a hard discovery: You can have the most brilliant detective mind in the world, but if you're six years old, all the police are going to tell you is, \"BEAT IT, KID!\" In spite of this hardship, little Conan finds ways of bringing the guilty parties to justice -- although all too often, someone else takes the credit for his deductions.HIGHLY recommended.",

In continuing to watch, I've found Jeffrey Donovan's performances and character to remain interesting and engaging, the remaining cast excellent, and the episodes, overall, also interesting and well-written.

    "top_review": "This show can best be described as the most innovative, ground-breaking television show of the past 50 years. The reason this show is so ground breaking is the fact that it has used split screen cameras, and a real time format to create the element of a quality made show.The show follows the worst days of likable, down-to-earth hero Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) and each episode chronicles every hour of the day, and is shot in real-time. What makes this show so unique are the character relationships, the shows writing and the attention to detail.Whether the shows themes are about kidnappings, bomb threats, personal vendettas, assassinations, or terrorist attacks the themes are handled in such a compelling way that the viewer is hooked at every jump and turn.The viewers really learn to care about Jack as we learn more about his life and his past. Kiefer Sutherland was perfect for the role as Jack Bauer, so much that many people describe him as \"born for the role\". Dennis Haysbert does a superb acting job as Sen David Palmer and the show has an excellent group of characters who make the support team of the show and these include Carols Bernard as Tony and Elisha Cuthbert as Kim Bauer. A big bonus of the show is that 24 is constantly surprising viewers in unexpected moments, and you never know what to expect on the show. Anything can and does happen.The scripts on this show are top class and they deserve a mention in their own right. The attention to detail as I mentioned earlier is prominent with the real time aspect of the show. There are very rarely any mistakes with the time aspect of the show, and this is a strength of the show. The show always uses multiple split screen camera shots and this is innovative work because it helps to make the show seem realistic and also in real time. You will also see most of the camera focused on Jacks point of view and this is to make the show from a humans point of view and it helps to bring the viewer more involved in the show.The story may change; new characters may arrive and leave but one thing always stays the same; the underlying story of the show is about one mans fight to do what is right. If there is a bad aspect to this show it may be that some of the action sequences are a bit too predictable, but this is rare and should not detach from the viewers viewing pleasure of the show. This show will make you feel every emotion under the sun but nevertheless it is gripping, thrilling storytelling of the highest calibre. Long may this show continue and the legacy of this show will be remembered for many years to come. Miss this at your peril 10/10",

Depsite some commercial success, horribly retrograde filth like Pokemon do nothing but propagate this lack of imagination on the part of animators.Now we have Warner Bros., whose Batman and Superman animated revivals challenge the long-held belief that cartoons are plot-wise inferior to their big screen and big budget brethren. The Batman and Superman cartoons of the early 90s have shown us a deeper, more tortured and angst-ridden side to our comic book heros while at the same time remaining firm to their virtue and nobility. This is the stuff that real dreams are made of.Batman Beyond is just as ambitious. In the new world of technological revolution there is still need for a protector of justice. Like the original Batman, this one was again forged out of the victimology of social corruption and decadence.By combining complex plot, intelligent dialogue, great Japanimation, an incredible cast of voices that at times have included Stockard Channing, Paul Winfield, James Sikking, Michael Gross, and Kevin Conroy, Warner Bros. has recapitalized the Batman myth for yet another generation. This new series is so smart and so edgy that I am constantly amazed by the levels of irony and metaphor.

    "top_review": "I'm a sucker for the private investigator sub-genre of crime fiction. Even when not done well (HBO's \"Bored to Death\" tries a new take, but gets thwarted by blas\u00e9 hipster posturing), there's something about the lone wolf not-quite cop, on his own, down on his luck, but armed with a healthy supply of street smarts and canny insight into human nature. Well, along comes \"Terriers\", and to my delight it knocks it right out of the park. Awash in the over-saturated hues of sun-soaked San Diego, a couple scrappy p.i.s (one's a former cop-slash-alcoholic, the other a former nickel and dime guy) completely re-energize the genre with wit, smarts, and a healthy dose of real pathos. It's \"The Rockford Files\" meets James Elroy, in the way that its grungy just-this-side of oblivion heroes get embroiled in a corruption plot that is far above their pay grade. Perhaps one wouldn't necessarily think of the term \"seedy underbelly\" when thinking of San Diego, but the show's creators surprise us with what they dig up.The series excels in nearly every aspect of hour long drama: crisply directed action, rich supporting characters, intriguing criminal activity, and a whole host of demons for its protagonists to wrestle with, mostly falling on the back of Donal Logue's Hank Dolworth (interesting that one of TV's other most fascinating anti-heroes is the aptly named Hank Moody of \"Californication\" - both Hanks give us 2 very different sides of southern California survival). Logue, long time one of my favorite just-on-the-verge-of-stardom actors, is absolutely brilliant here. Older, raggedy, and noticeably slim-downed, Logue fits this part to a T, and will hopefully find himself in all sorts of career skyrocketing joy once \"Terriers\" gets the audience it deserves.The rest of the cast is also uniformly excellent. Michael Raymond-James as Hank's partner Pollack is just as grungy but a bit lighter - which is fascinating as he is the former crook. And Rockmond Dunbar as the cigar-filter chomping Detective Gustavson - Hank's ex-partner - is perfectly pitched as the hard-ass cop whose soft spot for Hank keeps him situated as a dark ally: maybe he'll help, maybe he won't.Series creator Ted Griffin, late of \"Ocean's 11\" and \"The Shield\", has created a fascinating world of cops and crooks and those in between, that feels well-lived in, while remaining fresh at the same time. If the show continues to pump blood into its true beating heart - the relationship of Hank and Pollack, and both of their personal quests - then he should have a hit on his hands for years, and something that may indeed stand the test of time. A classic in the making, \"Terriers\" is the best new show on television, and already one of the best period.",

    "critic_rating": "8.6", 
    "top_review": "Since its initial telecast, back in 1967,  this enigmatic classic has evoked every  reaction from awe to contempt.  Given  the amount of serious critical attention  THE PRISONER has received, and given that  a whole society has been created in its  honor, I'd say the awe has won out, and  I vehemently agree that THE PRISONER  deserves to be honored as one of the  truly artistic programs created for  commercial television.However, I can also understand the  frustration many viewers have felt.   Over the course of its seventeen episodes,  this offbeat spy thriller becomes further  and further offbeat until it ultimately  transforms into surrealistic allegory.   I confess I'm not sure whether this  transformation was intended as a  complete surprise, or whether you were  supposed to know where the show was  going, but in either case, I think you  can better appreciate the series if  you can see the earlier episodes as  preparation for what's to come.THE PRISONER's title character is a  British secret agent (series creator  Patrick McGoohan) who may or may not  be SECRET AGENT's John Drake.  The  story begins with him suddenly and  mysteriously resigning, then just as  suddenly and mysteriously being  rendered unconscious and transported to  a place known only as The Village, the  location of which is known only to those  who run it.  The Village is a prison  camp, but  with all of the amenities  of a vacation resort,.  Attractive  dwellings, shops, restaurants, etc.  exist side by side with high-tech  methods of keeping order and extracting  information from those who won't give  it up willingly.  Those who try to escape get to meet Rover,  a belligerent weather balloon capable  of locomotion, and seemingly of  independent thought.  It appears (to  me anyway) that the authorities can  summon Rover, send it away, and give  it instructions, but that it acts more  or less on its own initiative.  Rover  deals with fugitives by plastering  itself against their faces, rendering  them either unconscious or dead,  depending on how bad a mood it's in.   Twice, we see it haul someone in  from the ocean by sucking them up  into a whirlpool it creates.Citizens of The Village, including those  in authority, are identified only by  numbers.  Our protagonist is known  only as No. 6 throughout the entire  series.  The Village is run by No. 2,  who in turn reports to an unseen and  unidentified No. 1.  No. 1 is  apparently an unforgiving boss, because  No. 2 is always being replaced.Shortly after he arrives in in the  Village, No. 6 is informed, by the  reigning No. 2, that he should count  on remaining there permanently.  If  he cooperates, life will be pleasant  and he may even be given a position of  authority.  If he resists -- well, the  only restriction they're under is not to  damage him permanently.  To satisfy his  captors, No. 6 need only answer one  question: `Why did you resign?'  His  question in turn is, `Who runs this  place?  Who is No. 1?'Most of the episodes deal with No. 6's  attempts to escape, and/or his captors'  attempts to break him, although there  are a few side trips.  Several episodes  suggest that No. 6's own people may be  involved with running The Village.  Some  of the episodes are fairly straightforward,  while others leave you with questions as  to exactly what went on.  It's important  to note that several of the more  obscure episodes -- for example, `Free  for All' and `Dance of the Dead' --  are among the seven episodes that  McGoohan considers essential to the series.  And then we come to the final episode,  `Fall Out,' which promises to answer all  the burning questions the viewers have  been anguishing over for seventeen weeks  -- and which so frustrated and angered  those viewers back in 1967 that McGoohan  had to go into hiding for awhile.   Of course, I can't reveal any of  the really important details,  because, as No. 2 says in the  recap that begins most of the episodes,  `That would be telling,' and as all  of us IMBD contributors know, `telling,'  is frowned upon.  However, to come back  to the point with which I started,  you should be prepared for a resolution  of an entirely different nature than the  one you'll probably be expecting -- a  resolution that forces you to rethink  your entire concept of the Village, and  of the intention of the series.  If  you aren't ready, you'll be frustrated.   If you are, you can accept THE PRISONER  is the spirit in which it was offered.",

    "top_review": "The creators of Northern Exposure (NX) gave us a true viewing treat. While many shows tend to dumb down to the audience, NX asked you to wise up to it. With dialogue that in some cases you needed a dictionary for, you had a sense that this is how people should interact with one another. Although the characters were sometimes tough on each other, it was done lovingly. For example, Maurice and Joel never really liked each other, but would always be there to help each other out, out of respect. If only we lived in a world like this. With all that said, you sensed these characters were for real. As if you had been transplanted into Cicely, Alaska.NX wasn't all mushy either. It picked its moments, and did so with perfect vigor. Intertwined were moments of humor, sometimes laugh out loud, sometimes feel-good with a smile. Joshua Brand and David Falsey found a way to work your emotions, tugging on them like a heartstring. You really fall in love with the characters. Never have I seen a show where you cared so much about what happened to them, with many elements of surprises. I found myself even weeping with Maurice (probably the coldest of the main characters) when he mourned his brother during a Kaddish that Joel was giving in remembrance to his Uncle Manny. You know why? Because you learned of his brother's passing and how it affected Maurice throughout the series. You really felt his pain. As well, I laughed out loud when Joel was being accused of being a Russian spy by the town when they were sick or when a recently squished Rick was brought in on the satellite that killed him during his funeral. I couldn't help but smile when after a picture was taken of everyone at Joel's house; they just scanned over it while Chris talked about being a community and what it means to be neighborly.This show really taught me a lot, too. I learned of Shittake mushrooms, good French wines, Ingmar Bergman, tribal customs and stories, and clarified butter. I began watching this show in my mid-twenties when it was aired on A&E. I was just discovering the world around me and became a major influence on how I think and act now. I never knew a show that did as much research on things as this. They dig out obscure information that is true. They writers really did their homework and delivered with results. I wish there could be more creative writing in an era where reality shows and asinine sitcoms dominate the airwaves.If you get the chance, do yourself a favor. Watch NX, and do it from the beginning. You'll be treated to hours of enjoyment. Especially Chris Steven's diatribes, which gave you moments of reflection. I have every episode on tape and watch it over and over. Everyone I've turned on to this show ends up loving it. One person even dreamt (in their sleep) about being there from time to time. I have shared that same experience. It usually comes when I haven't watched it in a while. I guess you can say I get withdrawal symptoms. Northern Exposure is addicting. A kind of drug I love being addicted to.",

And, wonder of wonders, the use of ironic and tragic comedy is without peer in what I've seen in the TV world in recent memory.

We watch \"24\" and have enjoyed other edge-of-your-seat shows like \"Alias\" and \"Prison Break\" in the past, but we agree that Survivors is usually more entertaining than any of them.Perhaps the total number of viewers in the UK hasn't been up to hopes, but maybe if demographics (average income, education level, etc.) are taken into account, PLUS you add in American viewers (via BBC America), the BBC should reconsider its decision and renew this riveting program for a third season (or \"third series,\" as they call it) and beyond.The premise of the show seemed fairly mundane: a virus wipes out most of humanity and we view the struggles of a ragtag bunch of survivors. But, despite a few logical lapses, the execution is excellent and the program is exciting to watch. Most of the characters are very well realized and acted, and the plot (episode-by-episode and ongoing too) is much better than one would expect. We look forward to watching the program every week.They brought Doctor Who back (and we love it). Survivors deserves at least another few seasons -- especially given the miniscule 6-episode British seasons, which are about 1/4 as long as seasons of most American programs!",

That was because he'd given up his own apartment to his grandmother after she'd been forced to leave her own place.  He stayed above the garage for so long because he loved he Cunninghams like his own family.  He essentially was a part of the family.  In the last season, he did move out into a regular apartment.

Doesn't sound like a loser.As well, Fonzie also worked several jobs at once.  He was (or became) the owner of the garage he worked at.  When Arnold's burned down, he put up money to help Al rebuild and became the part-owner.  Then, he started teaching shop class at Jefferson High.  He later went to a tough school and became the Dean of Boys, so he could help kids who needed guidance.So, I think Fonzie was a cool character not because of his leather jacket, or motorcycle, or his prowess with girls.  I think he was cool because he was a good person who was always willing to help a friend in need.  Did you ever see the episode where Al wants to go down to Alabama to join a Civil Rights march?  (This was a later episode when the time was the 1960's).  Fonzie is concerned about Al's safety and goes with him to look out for him.  Fonzie joins Al and a young African-American man in a sit-in at a diner.  That doesn't sound like something a loser would do.",

They don't try to tie up plot threads, illuminate the backstory, or even have the characters leave their neighborhood to fight crimes as depicted in the opening and closing credits. None of that is necessary. Instead, they just bring us a stripped-down, personality-driven yukfest that shows encumbered with the usual baggage simply can't match. ATHF meets---nay, far exceeds!---my personal gold standard for comedy: that the jokes should not only be funny, but be ones I couldn't possibly have thought up for myself, and that there not be a moment's lag time between them.Watching it is like eating potato chips (um, guess I mean fries) of pure, mindless laughter.

(LOL) The continuing adventures of Detective Inspector Lewis and his trusted sidekick Detective Sergeant Hathaway stand out for the strength of production values, acting, writing, and direction that are credits to the Masterpiece: Mystery! series tradition here in the States and television anywhere. Unlike most reviewers, I've never seen the Inspector Morse series which gave this one its genesis, but be assured I will be checking those discs out on Netflix shortly. Just know that this series stands completely on its own and is without peer, at least in my experience. The principals all acquit themselves with increasing wit and flair as the series progresses, creating a palpable matrix of living relationships which provide the sort of ongoing back story that insists you return, like that finish at the end of a wee dram of single malt, for more. The cinematography (this is shot on film, not video), score (it is far too high quality to call it simply \"music\"), sharp pace of direction, and of course the acting, by both regulars and guests, is more than first-rate--it is better than we have any right to expect. Oxford is a very photogenic backdrop for the stories which manage rather niftily to send up the upper class snobbery of England at the same time that it celebrates the hallowed tradition of academia and culture with which it is inextricably entwined. The squarely middle-class education and perspective of the older Lewis is also projected against the Cambridge-educated Hathaway, a lapsed theologian who is at once intellectually on par with these Oxford denizens while yet at the same time apart, due to the inter-school rivalry as well as his own lineage, which we learn more of as the series progresses. The subtle windups Lewis and Hathaway deliver each other are to be savored, for they are the real mark of affection and respect each develops over time for the other.That each episode fills in certain intriguing details of our regulars' back stories at the same time it guides us, with red herrings aplenty, through the solution of some very puzzling cases is also part of the magic of Inspector Lewis. I find myself at moments ignoring the developments of certain cases, not because they are dull, but because I am so consumed by disclosure of personal details and the repercussions amongst series regulars. Their lives matter to us, greatly, and their relationships are not completely static.Never dull, frequently witty, and almost always a step ahead of us, Inspector Lewis is a series that entertains at all times, often plumbs surprising emotional depths, and occasionally achieves the elusive grace of art.",

This show crossed them both perfectly and offered an interesting new story with every episode. So what do the execs at the Sci-Fi Channel do? They cancel it. And it's not because the rating were low either. It was because they were not reaching the correct demographic. What IS the correct demographic exactly? The show revolves around a wizard named Harry...Dresden; a Chicago-based Private Eye. He helps out the police with their bizarre, head-scratching cases without ever revealing his powers. Armed with a hockey stick sceptre and a drumstick wand, his methods occasionally rouse The High Council, the magical governors who are always weary of Harry since he used Black Magic to kill his uncle.It can be accused to ripping-off anything from CSI, Buffy, Charmed or even Law & Order, but I think that The Dresden Files stood well on its own two feet. The cold, wintry (often Xmasy) feel to the show and the naturalised look sits well with the supernatural element and there is a dynamic range of characters. Though my favorite has to be Bob (Hrothbert of Bainbridge), the ghost of a gentlemanly wizard cursed to live the rest of eternity inside his own skull when he's not helping Harry with his latest case. He's played by Terrance Mann, who you may remember as Johnny Steele, singing 'Power of the Night' in the original Critters movie.I am sad that The Dresden Files never made it past a single series.

    "top_review": "What more can I possibly say about a TV show that has already been praised to death?  I was 15 when the Simpsons first aired and I'm 25 now.  I've seen every single episode, and I'd have to say it's a rare combination of factors that come together to make The Simpsons the best show ever.It's a very clever and intelligent show - they never dumb anything down - and as creator Matt Groening has remarked, \"The Simpsons is a show that rewards paying attention.\"  There are always enough obscure pop-culture references or subtle background gags to ensure that the second, third, or tenth viewing of an episode will find you noticing something you hadn't before.In the early days of The Simpsons, they derived a large part of their popularity from the everyday, down-to-earth, unglamorous, average-blue-collar-slob aspect of the Simpson family.  Homer is lazy and doesn't like his job, Bart doesn't excel at school, the plastic ketchup bottle they use at the dinner table makes that farting sound, and so on. This aspect of the program contrasts it with popular 80's family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show which always featured impossibly well-functioning families who got along a little too perfectly and usually learned a neat little lesson at the end of each episode.  An early tag-line for The Simpsons said that they \"put the Fun back in Dysfunctional.\"Perhaps this blue-collar-slobness by itself is nothing shockingly original - think of previous TV shows such as Roseanne, Married with Children, All in the Family, The Honeymooners - but the Simpsons doesn't stop there.  This show is extremely densely packed with jokes - everything from cerebral witticisms and sly satire to Homer falling down and going \"D'oh!\"  Because it's a cartoon, the writers can get away with surreal gags such as the time Homer tells a joke which falls flat, after which a long silence happens which is punctuated by a single tumbleweed rolling through the Simpson's living room.There are just too many things to mention about The Simpsons.  It can be touching occasionally; more often the viewers are treated to an unequalled cavalcade of obscure references, surreal sight gags, wacky adventures, self-mocking irony...   The list goes on and on.  Just watch it, else you're missing out on one of the most important elements of 1990's popular culture.",

Just look at One Tree Hill and The O.C, both are based around teens with the occaisonal adult and it's not like either of them have awards coming out their back sides.Yeah, it's acting isn't amazing, but seriously what did you expect? I can't think of a similar show with better acting. Again, referring to other teen dramas: One Tree Hill and The. O.C, neither of them have good acting. Shows like this are like temporary soap operas and there isn't any decent actors in any of them! Why is that? Because it's so god damn unrealistic. 90210 is unrealistic, which is why you may consider the acting bad. A situation you've never thought of happening jumps out at you and you have no idea how the characters or yourself should react.Okay, it's a remake, so what? It may be a remake type spin off show to the 1990's 90210, but it is still a different show. If you don't compare it to it's predecessor then it makes the show much more enjoyable. I'd say the remake is better anyway, it's just more up to date. I know I wouldn't be able to enjoy that out of date BH90210.Seriously, stop comparing it to the first one, stop treating it like it SHOULD have been made to win Oscar type awards, stop complaining about the acting when you have no idea what makes a decent actor and stop the ridiculous hating for no reasons other than the fact you \"hate Annie because she is annoying\".",

This is the most real portrait of the city I've seen, and it does justice to the spirit of the city. Living here is a strange experience because it feels like a small town: you run into the same people again and again; people are always eager to show newcomers where to eat or drink or listen to music; people are very friendly; people do tend to cringe when visitors never stray from Bourbon (even though Bourbon is fun); people do have a fierce loyalty to local bars, restaurants, etc. Simon really captures all of this in the show. I never saw The Wire, but I'm impressed with the style of giving snapshots of the city or characters to build portraits of the people and the atmosphere - particularly the second line parade, John Goodman's character reading the Tulane renewal plan (brought back some painful memories for me personally), the Mardi Gras Indian practice, the reaction of people walking into a house or bar for the first time since the storm and surveying the damage.My main concern for this show: I have no idea how non-New Orleanians will feel about it. So much of my enjoyment of the show is rooted in seeing people I know and finally seeing a director do justice to some of the most wonderful things about this city. But I'm not sure how I would feel if I weren't so emotionally invested in it.",

    "top_review": "I'm not one to squabble over mismatches between source material and movies - as long as the story is consistent within its own universe. From this point of view, this series has managed to put all of the recent Hollywood adaptations to an absolute shame. First of all, the adaptation is so good that sometimes it's difficult to say where the Dumas novels end and where the adaptation begins. Sure enough, the events from the books aren't borrowed entirely and sequentially but rather they are somewhat transformed and scattered.The main plot points are there, but with extra background and extended events which strengthen character building.This is definitely a necessary step especially because the original story (so very popular) has turned the characters, their demeanor, names and status into stereotypes ... and stereotypes can be boring especially when the original context is transformed. The musketeers keep their names, general demeanor but their background stories are enriched (while keeping the main points).Aramis is a former priest with a soft spot for the ladies ... but there's much more in the hold. Athos remains somewhat misanthropic with lots of mystery behind him (and with a history alongside Milady de Winter) Porthos gets more of an overhaul especially given the original largely straightforward character type. D'Artagnan in turn seems to be more of a bon-vivant type now and although he keeps his original motivation and history, he is portrayed here a lot more child-like. I'm not saying this is necessarily bad, but we'll have to wait and see what the writers will make of it.Richelieu gets a great portrayal from the future Doctor Who actor, greatly improving upon the original character with more details and more political plots which are mostly well-thought out as opposed to the incredibly brainless plots of the Hollywood movies. Let's hope they'll keep up the kind of work that we've been shown in the first few episodes.Obviously, nothing is perfect. There are inconsistencies here and there as well as questions left hanging. But we've got at least a season to see where they lead.",

The concept is unique and I like it. Humans who live inside 50 meters high walls to protect themselves from titans (giants), Eren the main character feels unpleasant about it compared to everybody else because that's not really true freedom for a human to be \"livestock\" inside walls, waiting to get eaten by titans. One day, and that would be the day they would all remember for eternity, the day when first wall fell and hell broke loose, this is where the story starts. And it just gets better and better!

    "top_review": "Okay, now, I'll be frank. When the first information on \"X-Men: Evolution\" was released, *everyone* thought it would suck. I did too.Then, I saw it. And against all expectations, the product was a very, very good show.There's a way to sum up people's attitudes - those who don't like it are largely those who can't get beyond the fact it doesn't follow the comics versions of the characters. Well, tough noogies, people, it's a different interpretation of the characters, and it's an interpretation  that works extremely well. If you let a purist attitude blind you to enjoying them, then it's your loss. Very few good cartoons have come out of America in the last couple of years, in part as a result of the over-reliance on Japanese animation, which is currently so popular. But of the few quality shows that were made, \"X-Men: Evolution\" is easily one of them. It's a series with a direction - underlying story threads and sub-plots are all intricately woven together, although sometimes they get a little buried under the focus of the episode, which can sometimes be something as boring as \"new kids take jet for joyride.\"Many of the characters aren't THAT different from their original selves, anyway, just made a bit younger. Rogue stands out as the character altered the most, but her new goth look is a brilliant take on the character, and a very welcome departure from the \"Woe is me, Ah can't kiss anybody!\" attitude that we've suffered through in the past. The show's \"new\" character, Spyke, is really quite needless, though - essentially a P-C version of Marrow (from the comics), he is reduced to a nonentity for much of the season season, because he just doesn't *need* to be there. And say what you will about Nightcrawler, but I just really wish they'd hired an actor who could DO a German accent.Speaking of voice acting - \"X-Men: Evolution\" easily scores high points in that area, too (German accent notwithstanding...), with a lot of experienced talent lending their voices to the show. Beautiful animation - that's on a par with, and surpasses a lot of, the current wave of Japanese anime - finishes off the whole package - I swear, this is the only cartoon I have ever seen where *dancing* has been animated so well.So, that's \"X-Men: Evolution.\" Take it or leave it. But I recommend quite heartily that you take it.",

Ever see a really bad movie? I know you have, we also know how much we love to make fun of a really bad movie, that's exactly what the characters of Mystery Science Theater 3000 do, they take the worst movies of all time and absolutely tear them a new one. They are like the friends we want to have around when you feel like you wasted your money at the movies, because at least you can get a good laugh at just making fun of it. I saw this show for the first time in 1998 when my parents finally broke down and got cable, the first channel that popped up when I turned on the TV was the sci fi channel and what looked like a fun werewolf movie... then I noticed three little figures in the corner. I didn't get it, why are they talking through the mov... oh, because this is a really bad movie and they are saying everything that I am thinking... I'm in love! At that point I was hooked and tuned in every week to see a new episode.The show first started off with Joel, a man who is stranded on the satellite of love space ship with several robots: Crow T. Robot, Tom Servo, Gypsy and Gambot. He is being tortured by our villain, Dr. Forrester with terrible movies. Eventually in the middle of season 5, we got a new host, Mike Nelson. He was a slave to Dr. Forrester, but is now sentenced to the same fate as Joel to see the most horrible movies of all time. We also later on got a different villain, Dr. Forrester's mother, Pearl Forrester who is trying to take over the world while presenting horrendous movies to Mike and the bots.The great thing about this show is it didn't just make fun of horror movies, nope, any bad movie could face the hand smack of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I couldn't choose a favorite episode, but I stepped into the Mike era so most of my favorites come out of those seasons like: Prince of Space, The Final Sacrifice, Space Mutiny, Girl in Gold Boots, The Brain that wouldn't Die, Squirm and Soultaker. Not only do they make fun of movies, but \"educational\" shorts as well with the scary \"A Date With Your Family\" and \"Spring Fever!\" that are frankly the most disturbing thing on film. Like most shows, not every episode is a classic, but is always guaranteed a good laugh. There are some haters on this show saying that they hate seeing people talk through the film, if you really want to see films like the one's they make fun of, I pity you.",

    "critic_rating": "7.2", 
    "top_review": "I recently watched the first 2 episodes of Ultimate Spider-Man and I can honestly say that I have never wanted to STOP watching a Spider-Man cartoon before in my life... until now.I have been a big fan of the Spider-Man comic series for many years and have liked almost all of the cartoon iterations of him, but this one just hurts to watch. I understand that Spider-Man is supposed to be a smart-mouthed teen who likes to make jokes while fighting crime, which is my favorite part about the character, but this show just takes it to an extreme. The show feels like a very awkward mix of Family Guy, Teen Titans and The Emperors New Groove... NONE of them in a good way.I think one of the biggest problems for me was how much the story was broken up by all of the \"cut away\" scenes. There would be an action scene going on, or a scene with meaningful dialog and it felt like every 5 seconds, they were shoe-horning a stupid \"this is almost as bad as the time I...\" joke, much like in Family Guy; The problem with this is that it broke up EVERYTHING that was happening in the show. The reason that Family Guy is able to get away with doing \"cut away\" scenes every few seconds is because that is what the show is all about. You don't watch Family Guy for the story or the action, you watch it to laugh at the jokes, which can actually be funny because they aren't being aimed at children. I understand that Spider-Man is a show made for children and I get that the characters aren't going to be nearly as serious as they are in the comics, but I feel like this was just too far from the source material for me to enjoy it.Another thing that bothered me was how just a few years ago we had, in my opinion, one of the best Spider-Man shows to date, Spectacular Spider-Man, and it was canceled in only it's second season. I had really high hopes for Ultimate Spider-Man to fill the void that Spectacular Spider-Man left, but it just didn't deliver at all.I guess I should address the animation for the show as well, while it looks good in still shots, much of the action gets... fuzzy? A lot of the time it looks like they got lazy while animating the action sequences and just decided to make everything blurry so it looked like he was doing something really cool, but all that it did was give me a headache. The character designs are good and they COULD look great, but it just seems like they got lazy with animating them; Yet another reason why I think that Spectacular Spider-Man did it better, the animation was much smoother.As far as the voice acting on the show goes, they all seem to have done a really good job... with what they were given to read. So much of the writing in this show just seems so forced; It seems like they thought that the more jokes that the shoved in and the more that they made it like Family Guy, the better that it would be... because, hey, people like Family Guy, right? Now, You may be asking \"why was Spectacular Spider-Man so much better\" and the most honest answer that I can give you is that it seems as though Marvel actually put a lot of work into Spectacular Spider-Man. I'm not saying that they didn't put a lot of work into Ultimate Spider-Man, but it's much harder to see in this one. The character designs in Spectacular Spider-Man may not have hit all of the right points for some people, but I really enjoyed it. The action in the show looked really good and it was easy to follow exactly what was happening, because you didn't have a bunch of blur that you had to try and see everything through. The story for Spectacular Spider-Man was your standard Spider-Man fare, but while it was a show essentially for kids, it also appealed to many adults as well. The show had its serious moments along with its really funny ones, which is what I think Spider-Man is all about. It took all of the things that were great from the 90's Spider-Man show, like the stories and the great scripts and coupled them with great animation and some really talented voice actors to give life to the characters.I really wanted to like Ultimate Spider-Man, but I just didn't. I feel like if this show was about just another teen superhero other than Spider-Man it would have been much more forgivable, but for it to take such a dump on such a beloved character, it is just really sad to see. Now all that I can do is hope that the new Spider-Man movie can really bring something good to the table.",

Some of moments of comic genius written by creator John Sullivan are on a completely different level to anything else seen on British TV. Yes, you can talk about Del falling through the bar, and yes you can talk about the blow up sex dolls. They are classic moments, but there are so many hugely funny scenes that are so advanced, it really is amazing how JS thought of them. For example, my personal favourite is in the episode Heroes and Villains when Del Boy and Rodney go to a publican's ball dressed as Batman and Robin - a good idea for a fancy dress party. But then comes a catalogue of comic brilliance. Firstly, (already dressed in their outfits) the van breaks down in the middle of Peckham. DB and R do a runner and scamper through Peckham only to confront a group of muggers. The muggers leave their intended victim convinced it's the real Batman and Robin! Then comes Rodney's wonderful clench fist (ala Robin) before shouting to Del \"Let's go\" - in my opinion it's the perfect line and one of British comedy's greatest moments. And to top it off, they finally get to the ball only to find the landlord has 24 hours earlier died. Everyone is dressed in their funeral outfits except for our 'caped crusaders' who stand out like a sore thumb.John Sullivan's achievements of rattling up 25m viewers is fully justified. Not only does he produce perfect comedy, but he couples that with real drama such as the death of Grandad, Cassie's miscarriage, and Rodney's wedding.We have grown up with the Trotters - and we have died with them in some cases. But the true brilliance of David Jason, Nick Lyndhurst, Buster Merryfield and of course John Sullivan will live on.Can I give it 11/10?",

In early years they shared their council flat with 'Grandad' (until the death of actor 'Lennard Pierce') later to be replaced by 'Uncle Albert', a WWII Navy veteran with an anecdote for any occasion. Del and Rodney are best described as lovable and harmless black market traders; they buy and (try to) sell almost anything and many an episode is based around some faulty/stolen stock bought by Del. As with other comedies from writer John Sullivan, the humor is devilishly engineered so as not to telegraph the jokes before the punchlines and there's always a strong cast of support characters.

Jay Sherman is my inspiration for my excessive amounts of film reviews. He was never afraid to speak his mind about the garbage distributed by Hollywood ever week. His classic line, 'It stinks' inspired me to find those horrible films and make sure I warned others before it was too late. He is a God among Gods in my book!Created by the same team that did The Simpsons, Sherman great to life through not only the witty banter that leapt from his mouth, but also his surrounding characters. Parodying some of cinema's finest, you cannot help but laugh at this obese critic that wants nothing more than to have respect and eat his Charleston Chew. Duke Phillips is one of the funniest characters created and provides some of the funniest social commentary on the extremely wealthy in our country. Sherman, in my eyes, represents the little man. While making $270,000 a year, he doesn't rise above anyone else. He reminds all of us of who we are, whether it would be running a marathon or trying to clean-up his hometown of New York, Sherman represents our desires and wants. One of our biggest desires is to see good cinema. We pay top dollar to see good movies, why does Hollywood continually fill our plate with all the bread we can eat before giving us the main course? Suddenly, we are too full to enjoy it.I would like to applaud Jay Sherman for his fight against a repetitive and uncreative Hollywood. As an avid film-goer it is nice to see the battle being fought in the animated world. Sadly, I only wish this series could have lasted long enough to endure some of the garbage released today. We need a new Jay Sherman to help us wade through and poke fun of today's Hollywood. I HIGHLY recommend this series to anyone that is as upset with Hollywood as I. This series will make you laugh at a large man that loves food and life.He is our, and especially my, hero!Grade: ***** out of *****",

Parker really emphasizes this \"dual role\" and she does it brilliantly....you'll find yourself really feeling for the character and cheering for her all the way. Elizabeth Perkins in the role of Celia, Nancy's close friend, is phenomenal. Watch her carefully in this show, her brilliant acting and her characters dry sarcastic nature provides much of the shows' comedic value but it is sometimes very subtle.

    "title": "SGU Stargate Universe", 
    "critic_rating": "7.7", 
    "top_review": "I'm going to try to address the many issues swirling about this series without spoiling the plot:1) Similarities to other shows: There has been a great deal of speculation that the show is a 'ripoff' of Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, or even Lost. While I certainly don't disagree that it bears a striking similarity to Battlestar Galactica, I don't count that as a strike against it.Prior shows are always going to have an impact on future shows. Film-making (whether it be TV or Feature) is an art that builds upon itself, and stands on the shoulders of those who came before it. The fact is the Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, and Lost are all GOOD shows, regardless of your impression of it or whether or not it struck you the right way, they were the best of their genres at the time, and even bent their genres into something new.That being said, to call this show a 'rip-off' or 'carbon copy' of any of those shows is grossly over simplifying things and intentionally misleading. Perhaps we should just create a new genre name, like 'Adult Sci-Fi', so we can get over all these intellectual property theft allegations.2) Dissimilarities to other Stargate franchises: This review will probably take a lot of heat for this, but - past Stargate shows actually weren't very good. Don't get me wrong, I've watched every episode of SG1, and most of Atlantis (still working on that), and enjoy just about all of it, but even while enjoying it, I was fully recognizant of the fact that it wasn't actually good. It's campy. The acting is sub-par, even when there are good actors in the shows. The sets are generic and bland, reminiscent of the original series of Star Trek, the scripting is packed with fromage, and the plots, no matter how original, were all clearly predictable.But to a niche crowd (myself included) they were thoroughly enjoyable through a mixture of silly humour, sci-fi gratification, and a unique self-aware self-deprecation. But even so, the cinematography was regularly lackluster, the effects unconvincing, and the ratings carried along by loyal fans.SGU lacks most of these shortcomings. There is the occasional campy humour, though typically coming from the same character. In that way this one character, Eli, has come to be the only vestige of the old Stargate franchises. This is made believable, though, because this character is quite similar to the people (like myself) who enjoyed the camp of previous Stargate in real life.3) The mood: Many would say it's much too dark, both in production design and in mood. I say that it's about time. In past Stargate series', no matter how far gone a situation was, no matter how much danger they were in, the show was never EVER tense. It never mattered. Nothing ever really mattered. The characters were always too happy and fun and funny and confident and amicable to be capable of expressing any kind of peril. As such, the plots were always completely hollow. Nothing mattered, because it would all be fine in the end.The only episode in both original Stargate series' that managed to capture any kind of deep emotional commitment or tension was Heroes, which just happened to be filmed in the documentary style similar to that of SGU. I don't solely blame the cinematography for this effect, though, but instead, for just once, the characters were encouraged to be vulnerable and hurt, like real human beings.When people are in a serious situation, they get serious (mostly), and their flaws become more apparent. This is evident in this series, as it should be in such situations.4) The set/production design: As for the dark set design, it makes some sense, as the ship is very old, and trying to save power. In past Stargate, no matter how old something was, it always looked like it was cobbled together the day before. The ancient city of Atlantis looking like it was maintained by a team of maid-bots and carpenters right up until the team's arrival. I will admit that the purposeful gloom goes a bit too far at times, but as far as I'm concerned, that's better than skirting the edge of cardboard box grade production.SGU is simply a great show. Yes, it shrugs off its past franchise for the sake of its artistic intent, but it does so with wonderful results. The acting is largely superb, and even the episodes that in other shows would be considered 'in betweeners' come off as being some of the best episodes on television (like the episode Human).I definitely recommend this show to anyone, and I absolutely recommend that past Stargate fans try to leave their preconceptions at the door, and respect it as its own show.UPDATE: You will no doubt notice a massive spree of negative reviews on top of the 'helpful' pile on IMDb. Please take these with a grain of salt, as they are largely spam generated by a select few alienated Stargate fans who are working very, very hard to get this show cancelled. Rest assured, I myself have yet to meet a single classic Stargate fan who doesn't LOVE SGU, and I sure do know a lot of them!",

This takes me back, to the uniforms, buildings, concerns of a different time. One I sincerely hope will disappear forever.The problems of sending an East German to the West reflect the problems we had sending a Westerner east. The 1,001 ways to be tripped up brings back memories of complex plans that felt good, but you knew had huge holes in them no one had noticed.

The story that is told is great, maybe the greatest story I have seen in an anime. That is why I would rank it in my top 3, already. It is not only the story, but how the story is conveyed that makes this anime so great.The plot focuses on Tatsumi who is a boy from a poor village travelling to the capital to earn some money to save his home-town. He has learned to fight as a kid, being taught be a teacher in his village. He then meets a band of assassins and the story unfolds. I won't spoil any of the action as everything is part of the build-up, which makes this such a great anime. It is very simple, too. This makes it even more impressive, because I am quite shocked that no-body had made such a story-line before (in such a context).The theme of the series is assassination, heroism and social values (good and evil especially and love of course). It is the value-part and how it is conveyed that makes this anime into something special.The animation is quite great. It is simple, yet characteristic, and the fights are really great.The main focus is the progression of the story, though, and how the characters are related to in the sense of the main theme, which is good and evil I guess.I give it a 10/10, because it surprised me and tried something new and I liked it all together - better than most shows. I would compare it to \"Attack on Titan\", which is also a new show. AOT focuses on mystery and survival, while AGK focuses on societal and heroic problems (almost solely). I liked AGK better, even though AOT has better animations, because of the message AGK has speaks to me more! It is simpler, yet more striking.",

While not having any demographic numbers or survey results to refer to, I honestly believe it has a greater appeal to men than to women, although I do know both female and male fans of the series.Chuck is basically an interesting and hilarious blend of comedy and action. It does not imitate other series, and does not have a boring and stereotypical concept that you feel that you've seen dozens of times before. It's really a breath of fresh air in the ever-growing jungle of TV series, of which few are worth spending time watching - in my humble opinion.The main character, Chuck, is a geeky, modest, conscientious and somewhat shy person who is suddenly faced with many challenges in his daily life, trying to keep together the different parts of his life at the same time. His field of expertise is fixing computers. Viewers who are passionate about technology will probably be especially likely to \"get\" the humor of this show.The very most brilliant achievement of this series is the unique chemistry between the characters. No one take themselves too serious, the actors deliver great performance and consistence in every episode, and the characters' spontaneous reactions are often enough to cause great laughter. The only \"serious\" character I can think of (who is rarely funny - undoubtedly by intention) is Chuck's sister - Ellie. She contributes greatly to the \"balance\" mentioned below, and is in that respect an important character.Furhermore the series' perfect balance between gripping action scenes, risibility and self-irony is quite remarkable. It's both pleasant, fun and thrilling at the same time! I hope Chuck will continue to be such a success for a long time and that the creators continue to develop the concept so that it does not \"grow old\" fast. I look forward to its release on DVD in a greater variety of countries! Quickly summarized: A hilarious series, in my opinion the greatest American action comedy TV series ever!",

Even if you never watch SAO Season 2, SAO Season 1 is a must see for any Anime enthusiast and deserves a solid 10. Sword Art Online Season 2, brings us back to the mmo virtual world. However, unlike SAO Season 1, the first half of SA0 season 2 is primarily based on a gunslinger motif known as Gun Gale Online,In a virtual world comprised of guns and bullets, Kirito, uses a female avatar whilst duel wielding a violet energy sword and a 5.7mm FN Five Seven handgun. Not long after his experiences in Alfheim Online, Kirito is asked to assist in finding a mysterious player called Death Gun who is targeting the best players in the game, and is some how killing them in the real world.Though we reunite with some familiar characters in the past, GGO introduces a sexy sniper named Sinon who uses a PGM Ultima Ratio Hecate II which is a .50 caliber anti-material sniper rifle. As awesome as this season has been, it does lack a few of the intense emotional elements that made the first season so amazing. (Ex: The romance that developed between Kirito and Asuna, or the intense rage Kirito expressed to certain members of Laughing Coffin)Upon the conclusion of SOA season 2 mid-season finale, we are brought back to Alfheim Online where we are reunited with everyone in Kirito's party from SOA season 1. After a brief 4 episodes, the remainder of the SAO season 2 focuses on an entirely new guild known as the \"the sleeping knights\" guild. In a desperate attempt to achieve the unachievable \"the sleeping knights\" request Asuna's help after assessing her combat skills in a duel against their strongest member Yuuki.Growing up on anime, I have seen my fair share of classics, but the beautiful atmosphere, the breathtaking music, and the fantastic character development has quickly made SAO my favourite anime series. That being said, those who were a fan of SAO season 1 will notice an almost different atmosphere in SAO season 2. Personally I feel that SAO season 1 was better because the second half completely fed off the first half of the season. However, SAO season 2 had what appeared to be 4-5 parts. Although this introduces us to new characters, the plot felt a little scattered as it lacked the kind of consistency and the emotional build that was provided by SAO season 1. Overall, the second season of SAO was not fantastic, but I still believe it deserves a 7.",

Arrow is a darn good show, and the first Pilot episode is very strong and leaves little confusion behind this vigilante's origins. I felt that the main actor properly conveys a somber and mature attitude in contrast to the description we receive of him as a partying playboy before the shipwreck. The action is intense and not over the top or completely unbelievable. What we're presented with is a young man whose 5 years spent on an island have shaped him up into an agile warrior tasked with cleaning up his city from corruption. I can't wait to see what lies in store through future episodes, and I certainly hope this show delivers the goods. So far, I believe we're in store for some quality television this fall.",

I saw a couple of billboards about it but didn't make it a point to watch but I just watched it On Demand about fifteen minutes ago and found it very entertaining. While it wasn't hysterically funny it had parts that I giggled and I'm certain that as the season progresses, the jokes will get funnier. I grew up when TGIF was popular. Shows like \"Family Matters\", \"Sabrina, The Teenage Witch\", \"Step By Step\", \"Full House\", and others shows came on. It was a great family time for my parents and my brother and I'm certain this is a great show for family.I read a review saying that this show wasn't \"realistic\" but when it comes to sitcoms like this they're not supposed to be 100% realistic, they're supposed to entertain. The point is to take be inspired by realistic events and exaggerate them for TV's sake. I, personally, am happy that shows like are returning to TV. We need these family sitcoms to invade our TV screens once again so that we can have evenings, like in the past, to watch back to back shows that have values, yet make us laugh.I say, save the \"realistic\" film and TV for those the drastically deep people trying to win Oscars. This is a great family show, with good actors who have great chemistry on screen. They were some elements that were introduced in the pilot that have me intrigued for more to come. Watch this show.

It's an unfortunate pilot that leads viewers to think that the entire show will be a narrow diatribe on \"blackness\". But the show is titled \"Black-ish\" and it is appropriately titled.I don't remember what made me give it another chance, but I decided to watch the second episode and I was pleasantly surprised. But one episode does not a series make, so I watched the third. And I found \"Black-ish\" to be a very enjoyable comedy that had me laughing out loud numerous times.Like the Cosby family, this family speaks the Queen's English, and they prove to be rather genteel, despite the father's attempts to reconnect with \"the struggle\". He says, \"They (the younger generation) have nothing left to struggle for.\" The mother replies, \"Can't that be a good thing?\" And he answers, \"No!\" This show reveals some truths without spelling them out, like \"All in the Family\" did so well.\"Black-ish\" reveals that the father's discontent is a generational thing--something all of us feel who realize that young people cannot identify with the values and events of earlier generations. And it eventually shows that humanity trumps \"blackness\".I hope this show pursues the path it is on. There are lessons here for everyone. And the writers are mining laughs far outside the topic of race.The cast is excellent. I especially love the two youngest kids. The youngest daughter, Diane, is hilarious; she possesses a comic timing that far surpasses her age.Update 10/30/14: The show has proved that it is consistently funny. I am upgrading my vote to \"9\".Update 11/10/16: I am sorry to say that the show's focus and its comedic balance shifted in season 3. So my grading of the show applies only to the first two seasons.

The previous reviews, however, have not convinced me to change a single idea I had about the show; in fact, I find the other reviews to be epistemologically flawed in their vagueness and unspecified assertions.So as for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode and plan to keep watching. Below are my first five reasons to watch.1. Mireille Enos: Mireille Enos is a compelling actor. She may be typecast by some as the serious, unadorned detective in \"The Killing\", but in \"The Catch\" she is engagingly glammed up and beautiful, not with an 'I've-been-entitled-all-my-life' beauty but rather with an 'I'm smart and accomplished and insightful' beauty. Plus, she can sprint at an impressive speed after bad guys, showing that her outer strength can match the inner.2. Alimi Ballard: Alimi Ballard has always been smart and sharp, as his scenes on \"Numb3rs\" and \"CSI\" have shown, but his frequent relegation to a law enforcement roles in dark suits has required a restraint he can thankfully shed in this role. From the first time we see him on the links rocking a preppy polo-shirt-and-plaid-pants golf outfit, we know something will be different. On \"The Catch\", he remains sharp and smart, but as the 'fixer' of the confidence team, he morphs into changing roles with emotive style and wit.3. Mature Allure: It is great to see a show with a variety of actors over 35 (notwithstanding Rose Rollins' 20- something visage) who look great, dress great, speak articulately, and keep the story going. Much has been written about Peter Krause's casting and whether his age and recent role in Parenthood will affect audience perceptions. Not having watched \"Parenthood\" (or \"Six Feet Under\" or any of his roles, to be honest), he was a blank slate to me, and I was pleasantly surprised. My daughter remarked that the younger actor in the original pilot (still available online) is better eye candy, but Krause is a nuanced actor who conveys ambiguous intentions well. As a con man in his late 40s, it is more plausible that he has been around, seen more than he needed, and become reflective and conflicted about whether to stay in the game or pursue a connection with his latest smart, intriguing target. If his character were in his mid 30s with less knowledge, life experience and capital, would he really be ready to give up his best confidence-earning years to be with someone who could always put him in jail?4. The Artwork of Maria Kreyn: I am not sure how widely recognized artist Maria Kreyn is, but after this pilot episode, I'm sure she will gain a much wider audience. Her painting 'Alone Together', featured in \"The Catch\", is hauntingly beautiful and provides a captivating metaphor for the show's narrative.5. Open Spaces and Sunlight! Whenever I catch a few seconds of another TGIT/ShondaLand show, the scene is usually in an enclosed space such as a hospital room or dark office or someplace not particularly airy or (naturally) light. \"The Catch\", in contrast, is replete with outdoor settings, California sunshine, and floor-to-ceiling windows with luxurious day and nighttime views. This only added to my enjoyment of the show and desire to see more.",

    "top_review": "I saw the Japanese audio version with English subtitles. This is definitely a series for mature audiences. It's not afraid to go into unhappy situations and unpleasant characters, and show people battling with their various dysfunctions. Very psychological and surreal. If you've never seen Satoshi Kon's other works before, be prepared to initially go \"What the...?\". (Actually, I was still saying that more than halfway through this series, but that didn't stop me from watching it almost completely straight through.)Satoshi Kon has a distinctive style of delving into people's heads and meshing reality with fantasy. After first viewings of his works, I always get the feeling I'm going to have to go back several times and figure out everything I didn't catch.On the whole, this series is very deep and dark, but there are many humorous moments. Some of the episodes depart from the \"main\" characters and go off in really creative directions. It's not the best series I've ever seen, and it's certainly not for everyone, but it's good. If you are looking for something really different and are up for the mental stimulation, this is it.",

This makes him move back home to Stuckeyville where he begins to pursue Carol who he had a secret crush on in high-school. Besides Julie Bowen's Carol we also get to meet a whole gallery of interesting characters.The best thing about \"Ed\" is the relaxed, realistic and humane style of the stories and characters.

    "top_review": "Well, I'm trying to write a completely spoiler-free review here, but I guess it's safe to announce that 'Penny Dreadful' looks positively gorgeous. Great production design and cinematography: by the time we get to see Victorian London as night descends upon the city and the fog starts creeping through those narrow cobblestone alleys, nearly every frame looks like a beautiful, Gothic painting (and not once did I spot a fake looking CG-background). As far as the actors are concerned, they portray their obscure, troubled characters with a certain kind of \"theatre\" intensity that fits the story and the turn-of-the-century setting very well.Story-wise I don't want to give away anything \u0096 but of course, there are unholy things lurking in the shadows that need to be fought (and they look rather convincing: the make-up effects are another strong point of this show). Like the iconic \"Hammer Horror\" films of old (usually starring either Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing \u0096 or both), 'Penny Dreadful' draws its setting, characters and general inspiration mainly from some famously dark tales written by Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker and Oscar Wilde (and to a lesser extent from sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories). And just like the Hammer films - who may seem rather tame now but were shockingly violent for their time - this show is neither for purists of said literary works nor for the faint of heart.While some scenes are genuinely scary in a tension building, \"old school\" kind of way, we also get blood soaked action sequences that will probably put off some viewers, but seem entirely appropriate given the show's title (in the 19th century a \"penny dreadful\" used to be a booklet of cheap, sensational fiction printed on pulp paper which could be purchased for - wait for it: a penny).My overall verdict: 'Penny Dreadful' dishes out a hefty mix of gory violence, classic horror creatures, sex and action, but it never forgets to build atmosphere. The B-movie elements are undeniably there, but they're deliberate (the title says it all), and this is by no means a cheap affair. Beautifully crafted and with a great cast, I strongly recommend this show to anyone who likes the old \"Hammer Horror\" movies as well as films in the vein of Tim Burton's 'Sweeney Todd' and 'Sleepy Hollow'.But not just for the fans of \"Goth Horror\" is this well worth checking out; I would say that after 'True Detective' and perhaps 'Fargo' this is one of the most promising new TV-shows of 2014.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

    "top_review": "I mean it is awesome.This anime is based on the later part of the Dragon Ball manga written by the insanely talented Akira Toriyama. It is the follow on from the incredible Dragon Ball anime. (see review on my comments page)Set 5 years after the battle against Piccolo, Son Goku is living peacefully. But in the Dragon Ball universe peace is never lasting. Pretty soon the past he didn't even know he had escaped from catches up from him leading to a series of epic battles. The series goes across four main sagas- Saiyan, Freeza, Cell and Majin Boo. It takes place over a time span of about 27 years, which is pretty cool, and something you rarely get to see in a show like this. You get to see the characters grow up and change. Some character you will like a lot more by the time the series is finished. It contains some of the most likable characters of all time. I don't see how anyone could not like Son Goku. Or Son Gohan. Of course almost all of the old characters return in this series, although most have smaller roles. But most of them still get a chance at some action in at least one part. Piccolo and Kuririn still have fairly large roles, in the first half of the series at least. Yamucha and Tenshinhan have a lot less to do in the series, and Chaozu doesn't play much of a role at all. The villains are awesome. Vegeta is an awesome and well rounded character, Freeza may be one of the most memorable villains around, Cell is awesome just because of the basis of his character, and Boo.... well Boo is just the ultimate killing machine.The series is really different from the first series. Dragon Ball focused more on humour and martial arts, this focuses more on powerful ki blasts, hardcore action and ridiculously powerful character. It will never be the most challenging series around, but it is still a whole lot of fun. Great action scenes, really cool transformations, and a bunch of alien races. What more can you really ask for? The show spans for 291 Episodes, 13 movies and 2 TV specials. And you will still be sad when it ends.The Dragon Ball Z movies can be seen as separate stories, as most do not fit into the timeline of the series well. Also, you will find some of the material in the anime doesn't fit in very well. For the most part, this is because it is filler material that wasn't in the original manga. An example of filler is the Garlic Jr. Saga, which was put in after the Freeza saga and is a sequel of sorts to the first movie. The movies and filler are sometimes not as good as the stuff taken from the original manga, but that's not to say it isn't enjoyable. Some of the movies are pretty cool with villains like Brolli and Cooler. So I would recommend you check them out.As with Dragon Ball, there is not much to say about the animation, although by the end it had improved a fair bit. It is drawn well, and is nice to watch. The characters all have their charms in terms of the way they are designed. The music of the series is nothing spectacular either, although I like the theme songs to the series a whole lot.This is the show that, along with Evangelion: Neon Genesis, helped me get into anime, way back when I was just a dumb kid. Now I've grown up and become a dumb adult and I still love it. I watch it differently now than I did all those years ago. I grew up with the edited and dubbed version, which is great for kids, but if you are looking for the true series, try and get your hands on some DVDs with Japanese language options. I find them much better. But that's just me. No matter how you want to watch it, I would just advise you to sit down, switch off, and enjoy.With the upcoming Dragon Ball live action movie, I can only hope that it is successful enough to warrant a few sequels, as a Dragon Ball Z movie would be awesome. I would not expect it to quality cinema, just a whole lot of fun.There is also a sequel to the series, known as Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on the work of Akira Toriyama. Worth a look if you're a fan, but don't expect it to be as good as Dragon Ball Z10/10",

All of us seniors have imagined going back in time and doing some things over, but not just getting considerably younger and going forward with a new life. I found myself thinking, wow! what would I do, how would I handle family and finances now that I have an extra 60 or 70 years to live. How are people going to react to the behavior of a young man, mature beyond his years??

The characters are not \"trying\" to be funny, they are just exaggerated stereotypes which, mixed with the situations they are thrown in, can cause a few chuckles and a couple head shakes. The producers are definitely bold without being vulgar or condescending, so far... That said, it is very graphical and uncensored. The way the show is filmed really puts you in the action with the characters and add to the experience.The actors are all very good in their roles. Tim Robin plays an excellent perv Secretary of State and Jack Black's performance is toned down but still very enjoyable. I also like the way the Pakistani family is portrayed.All in, I really got hooked when I first saw the preview and the show did not disappoint. Through their personality flaws, the characters still manage to get things done and I just can't wait to see the next episode.With some of the lame shows out there, I find this one very refreshing and I hope they will stick to their plan and finish it right instead of selling out until it's not worth watching anymore.You should at least give it a try.Enjoy.

I love doctor/lawyer/medical/murder/investigation/puzzle type shows, and this show totally hooked me by the first commercial break in the pilot! This is the first original show on USA that I've seen, because my life is so busy that I just don't watch that much TV, but I have made room in my schedule for Hank. I love the fact that Hank isn't just treating the ultra-rich, but also people who need him and can't possibly pay. I also love the fact that the series started with interesting and complicated characters and I am really looking forward to learning more about Jill, Divya and Boris. Some of the personality types that Hank has come across are not just limited to the ultra rich, I've seen people who are obsessed with WebMD and pro-biotic yogurt as well as people who try to stay out of the limelight but at the same time know everything that's going on with everybody. I can't wait to see what happens next! ROCK ON USA!!",

I figured when I saw the teasers for it that all the funny scenes were in the commercial and there would be nothing left in the show, but I gave it a chance. I thoroughly enjoyed watching. Salma Hayeck was hilarious in her cameo. Vanessa Williams is E-V-I-L! She seemed to relish in her role! America is amazing as Betty. She plays the part with sensitivity and does not make Betty seem cartoonish, which would have been very easy given the \"ugly girl\" costume she's wearing.I will definitely continue to watch Ugly Betty.

The pacing is fast and fun and it never lets up on the jokes.Another aspect of this show that I really appreciate is the crafting of an interesting and expansive world all of it's own. The locations are all very different from one another and with their own 'charming' attributes. In the pilot episode we are introduced to Hell which has some very interesting stores.The characters are widely varied in both personality and appearance and it just adds to the enjoyment. From the pretty average main character Mark's demon spawn boss/girlfriend Callie to his zombie roommate Randall to his wizard co-worker Leonard at the Department of Integration, Ugly Americans has plenty of interesting characters to keep you laughing.All in all this show, despite having monsters and creatures, is basically a mirror of our own. It pokes fun at all kinds of situations in everyday life in a more grounded way than I thought possible in a show of this kind.

It delivers all those things and more.Jessica Jones tells the story of a retired superhero, a woman who tried to help and failed. Jessica is a broken character; she suffers from PTSD, has nightmares and constant flashbacks and drinks a lot. She's an incredibly compelling protagonist; flawed but strong, broken but fighting, sad but with a sarcastic edge that makes her funny and easy to love.The show isn't afraid to explore dark themes of sexual assault, rape and abortion and it does so with taste. The victims are not shown being raped; the viewer is just expected to believe them without titillating rape scenes to prove the facts.As a survivor herself, Jessica shows both the signs of her trauma and the will to fight back. Women in Jessica Jones suffer, they fail, but they fight.Unlike Daredevil's Kingpin, Killgrave is a threat from the first episode which results is better pacing (Daredevil took 4 episodes to find its feet in my opinion). Because of Jessica's PTSD, you constantly feel his shadow and the tension is constant. The show doesn't waste time with an origin story or training sequences; it takes you straight into the action and doesn't let you go.A definite success for Marvel.",

However, what it does, it does extremely well violence, gore, keeping with what you expect from horror and anime(breasts, short skirts, profanity, etc).The story is a very simple one to follow - it's the zombie apocalypse and a group of high school students and the school nurse are trying to survive. The characters are surprisingly deeper than you'd expect and the interactions are intriguing.The show is completely over the top as you'd expect; chock-full of scantily clad young women, tons of f-bombs, an exorbitant amount of blood, dismemberment and did I mention a lot of fanservice and nearly naked animated girls? That much may be hard for some to take, but when you can look at this show as an over-the-top tribute to horror, mostly traditional zombies and anime targeted at young men, you can really enjoy it.Let me go back to my mention of \"mostly traditional\" zombies - the zombies here are what Romero fans WANT to see. No running or smarts here; just slow walkers, flesh eaters and the undead. It's wonderful to see. There is one small twist in their zombie, but it's acceptable and helps with the pacing of the story.If you're a fan of zombies, Romero or Horror and have never watched an anime series before, this is where to start. I would highly recommend this to horror fans that aren't into anime, anime fans that like zombies, or anyone into zombies for that matter.",

    "top_review": "I saw episode one by accident while channel surfing Sunday night. After about 5 minutes, I was hooked. I can still say the same after episode three last night.The show has the feel and look of a first-class feature film. In fact, this type of cable series should make feature film producers start looking over their shoulders. With shows like this and others like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under, HBO and Showtime have given the industry something to be very worried about - and deservedly so. I go to the movies about once a week and all I can say is Hollywood better get its act together.The cast is superb, notably Michael Ealy and Oded Fehr. Ealy portrays his character, an undercover FBI agent, with just the right amount of passion, conflict, and boiling rage. Fehr is evil incarnate, although you can say that Dylan's line, \"Sympathy for the Devil\" is right on the nose here \u0096 more on that in a second. What a coup (and how ironic) to have an Israeli actor play an Arab terrorist. In an interview, this gifted actor expressed his revulsion and loathing for what \"Farik\", his character, represents. It made the part the most challenging thing he's done so far. Knowing that, as you watch him execute his nefarious plans, makes him even more compelling. Casting non-Arabs to play the other terrorists was a stroke of genius on the part of the creators of the show, Cyrus Voris and Ethan Reiff. These people are like us and live among us\u0085a disturbing thought and a very real possibility that cranks the fear factor way up.The interesting thing about the way that these Islamic extremists are presented to us is that you can't help feeling sympathy for them. They are likable and, in their own warped way, virtuous. That's another aspect of the show that pulls at the heart-strings and adds to the biting conflict that is the mark of a brilliant drama.You can bet that I'll be watching the rest of the series being broadcast back to back (there is a God!) for the next two weeks. They are replaying most of the episodes throughout this week, so if you missed the first ones, you'll have the opportunity to catch up. I suggest you start with Ep. 1 if you can although each one stands very well on its own.",

    "top_review": "The premise of 'Orphan Black' probably wouldn't even have to be half as intriguing as it is - and yet the show would still be fun to watch. Some TV-shows have such a great cast, you'd keep watching simply for the joy of seeing an outstanding ensemble act. To get those kinds of actors is a rare privilege for any show, and 'Orphan Black' is very privileged, indeed. Thankfully, it also has a fascinating story to tell, and that combination makes for one of the most entertaining and most original shows on recent TV.This review won't contain any spoilers, so I'm not going into plot details - just know that 'Orphan Black' delivers a perfect blend of mystery, sci-fi, thriller, drama and comedy elements - and many wonderfully colourful characters - that will make you want to binge-watch entire seasons. And while everybody in the cast does an outstanding job, one thing can't be stressed enough: Tatiana Maslany, the lead actress, is a revelation. It's hard not to spoil anything for those who still have the joy of watching 'Orphan Black' ahead of the them (and I think the first few episodes are enjoyed best without knowing what the show is about), but let me just say: you're not likely to see so many different aspects of one actress' amazing acting capabilities in any other show or film. So my verdict: Worth watching for the quality of the acting alone, 'Orphan Black' offers dark thrills, edge-of-your-seat suspense - and more than a few laughs along the way.

NBC has a tendency to let good shows go bad by lack of advertising. Lets hope that this isn't one of the next ones to go. Just Shoot Me has one of the best times because it is after Friends, Cursed, Will and Grace, and before ER. I was reading some Nielsen ratings charts and it looks like people go out of their way to miss this wonderful show. I know that it is almost always in the top ten (I think), but I always read bad reviews or opinions on it. Why? It is so good and creative.The characters are good because they are down to earth, hard working people. The cast isn't made up of the ritzy, glamorous celebrities we usually see. But it has one of the funniest casts I've ever seen. The scripts are extremely well played out with hilarious writing. I always find myself laughing like crazy at some of the simplest jokes. Good writing with different story lines that don't get old is what makes this show one of a kind.Good characters, simple yet complicated problems/plots, excellent writing, and a good setting (the work environment) is what I love about Just Shoot Me.

Cobb and of course the legendary Lummox.My favorite cartoons are \"The Lair of the Lummox\",\"Black Hole\",\"Ren's Toothache\",\"Sven Hoek\",\"Big Baby Scam\",\"Stimpy's Fan Club\",\"PreHistoric Stimpy\",\"Dinner Party\" and \"Reverend Jack Cheese\". Besides those cartoons there are several brilliant short commercials like \"Log\" and \"Chicken in a drawer\".And last but not least there is the great use of classical music in the series.The makers often use music from my favorite composer Tchaikovski,especially the \"Nutcracker\".A big thank you to John K. for his work!  10/10",

    "top_review": "Singers or rock bands will release an album. It may be their first and sometimes that album can be very successful selling copies by the bucketful and then when it comes to their follow up they disappoint. Sometimes the quality of that second album is higher than the first, but the case is the mainstream are either disappointed, or not interested. So it is with Chris Carter's Millennium, the second series he made after the mammoth success of his breakthrough series The X Files. Whereas The X Files is about how their is light at the end of that dark journey you may journey, Millennium was always about the opposite and thus the tone of the show was set and it may have led to the disappointing ratings and a sudden cancellation after three seasons. This is a shame as this was undeniably one of the finest television dramas ever created, giving us one of the best central performances in a television drama series and giving us sixty odd episodes of thought provoking if very disturbing drama.Whereas The X Files gave the audience a quirky set of characters in the shape of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, Millennium gave us the dark, secluded and world weary Frank Black, a man who investigated cases of serial killer using a unique, almost clairvoyant like ability to see what the killer was able to see. This set up was fantastic and like The X Files paved the way for over twenty mini movies a season. The stories were frequently clever and very well told and the main performance from Lancer Henriksen, the most underrated actor if there ever was one, was a sight to watch. The series was frequently disturbing, offering some of the most graphic images on mainstream network American television, the stories were hard hitting (incest and child molestation was dealt with at one point) and even the dip into X Files-esque waters worked as the paranormal element usually had something to do with the end of the world thus sometimes facilitating an explanation as to why so many bad things were happening in the world all of a sudden.The thing was viewers were not prepared for this in light of The X Files. While both shows had the same creator and the same writers and directors, there was no break from the inherent darkness of Millennium. The X Files would counter balance the conspiracy and horror stories with episodes of light humor and whimsical comedy, but here there was not. Even the odd comedy episode had darker elements. A cross over with The X Files would see the character of Jose Chung appear. He was dead at the end of the episode he appeared in. It was story developments like these that let one know that this was not show of optimism and hope, even if the title sequence tried to tell us that. Nope, Millennium was dark, hideous and violent, but it was still a great show that was never given much of a chance. The critics outside of horror and science fiction circles didn't like it and audiences found it too much, but there was denying that this was a superb show. Like The X Files the visual level and production values were superb and the moody Vancouver locations worked a charm, whilst there was rarely ever a bad episode. Here's hoping time will catch up with this fantastic show and that maybe some day an audience will appreciate it fully.",

    "top_review": "Angelo Badalamenti's sweet theme begins as smokestacks billow, and a robin assures the viewer of the presence of love in a little town located through the pines, just this side of sanity...or reality. Either way you choose to look at it (and the choice is yours), every episode of this groundbreaking television show grabbed the viewer in its seductive and destructive web... and wouldn't let go. \"Twin Peaks\" began a string of weird television shows in the early 90's, but, unlike those later shows, \"Twin Peaks\" would be beloved and remembered long after it was off the air. \"Twin Peaks\" has earned a spot next to \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Night Gallery\", and \"Star Trek\" in terms of pioneering television and in terms of a cult following deserving of conventions and fanzines. I believe that F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper is one of the most enjoyable and inspiring characters in television history. His simple passions and quirky behavior was a welcomed sight in our living rooms every week during the shows very short run in the late 80's and early 90's. \"Twin Peaks\" started out on fire, gaining exposure during the pilot's multiple airings. The mystery of Laura Palmer's murderer practically invented conversations at the water cooler. However, the shows second season was scheduled to air on Saturday nights at 10:00, an advertiser's no-man's land. And, with the shows fan base out on the late weekend nights, the shows network decided to cancel it. David Lynch, the shows co-creator, directed a theatrically released film prequel to \"Twin Peaks\", showing all who missed the shows airings what really happened to Laura the week of her death, and, finally, her killer. As a huge fan of \"Twin Peaks\", I will tell you that the circle of events that occur within the story enable the viewer to relive the events over and over, each time around with more intensity than before. When you view the movie prequel, diving right back into the series becomes the natural path, allowing one to see things again for what they really are... or aren't. I highly recommend owning the entire series. Without a network messing up your viewing time, you can see the mystery unfold at your own pace. Viewing \"Twin Peaks-Fire Walk With Me\", along with the television pilot and the entire 29 episode series (about 33 hours all together), is the most fascinating and satisfying viewing experience that the entertainment industry has offered me so far. The music, costumes, editing, acting, and direction all received Emmy nominations, leading one to conclude that \"Twin Peaks\" not only satisfied the public, but the critics as well. An incredible achievement, \"Twin Peaks\" is my all-time favorite television show.",

It hits many of the hard issues related to same-sex relationships, but also ties in a lot of humor and heart.

Sometimes the writers can be a little over the top with the \"gay\" outfits and one-liners (modern gay people are more likely to act exactly as everyone else), but the show does a great job of showing how normal their lives are otherwise.Shania and Goldie are also excellent characters with their own lovable quirks. Rocky's character is funny, but needs to become more than an African American clich\u00e9. Finally, Golie's grandmother Jane is probably the least believable character and needs the most work. It is understandable that the show wants to dichotomize her bigotry against Bryan and David's love, but it really needs to be toned down to seem realistic (actual bigotry is much more discrete).Overall, the New Normal is definitely worth watching!",

    "top_review": "First of all, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank George Lucas. He has been bashed quite often, recently for the Star Wars prequels and the new Clone Wars movie, but \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" is one of his greatest works ever, and even though it was never as popular as he had hoped for, he tried everything to keep the series going for as long as possible. Thank you for that! Now, don't expect something like the Indiana Jones movies when buying or renting this, because in that case, you will be disappointed. Archaeology is only featured in 2-3 episodes and there is a lot less action. But, if you are interested in seeing an exceptional TV Series, that invites you to be entertained and educated at the same time and you want enjoy a wonderful journey through the first two decades of the past century, this might be what you've been looking for.The character of Young Indiana Jones is portrayed by two actors in this series. Corey Carrier starrs as an 8 year old Indiana Jones, who travels around the world with his parents, the strict professor of medieval studies Henry Jones, Sr. and his caring mother Anna. They are also joined by Miss Seymour, an Oxford tutor, who teaches Indy everything about the history and culture of the countries they visit. Indy usually gets separated from his parents and Miss Seymour and explores everything on his own. Then a 16 year old Indy is portrayed by Sean Patrick Flanery. Indy participates in the Mexican Revolution and, being inspired by their causes and their resolute way of taking action against their enemies, decides to sign up in the Belgian Army and fight in World War I. In Mexico he also meets Remy, a Belgian, who will accompany him in many of his adventures.Most episodes start and end with so-called bookends, 3 or 4 minute segments starring George Hall as an Old Indiana Jones, who usually tells the stories of his youth to stubborn and arrogant people, with the purpose of making them better persons. Those bookends often provided some historical background for the episodes, but were cut out for the DVD releases in 2007. A shame, in my opinion.The series starts of great, already, with an awesome pilot that takes Indy to Egypt and Mexico, hunting down a tomb robber. After that the series leads Indy to many exotic locations, including British East Africa, the Congo, Barcelona, Petrograd, Vienna, Peking, the Ganges River, the South Pacific Islands etc. The cinematography is absolutely spectacular and on a big TV screen the images look magnificent. In this series, the world is shown more beautifully than hardly ever before.Lucas created this series for historical purposes, and Indy is involved in many events that actually took place, like the Mexican Revolution, a safari with Teddy Roosevelt, or the Battle at Verdun. There he also meets many famous people of that time including Pablo Picasso, Howard Carter, Sigmund Freud, Charles de Gaulle, E.M. Forster, Ernest Hemingway and many others.Besides that, the series also features quite a bunch of famous actors in supporting roles, like Elizabeth Hurley as Indy's first great love in London, Vanessa Redgrave as her mother, Catherine Zeta-Jones as a dancer and spy in a mission in Palestine, Daniel Craig as a German officer, Jeffrey Wright as Sidney Bechet, Friedrich von Thun as Albert Schweitzer and Christopher Lee as Austrian Foreign Minister Czernin. Harrison Ford actually reprises his role as an Old Indiana Jones in one of the episodes.The series has been nominated for many awards, including 25 Emmy awards, but wasn't very successful when first aired, mainly due to the fact that people expected a huge action series, similar to the movies with Ford. Don't make that mistake. Like I said before, if you want to be entertained and educated at the same time, treat your eyes with the most beautiful locations on Earth and meet historical persons, watch this series. You definitely won't be sorry!",

The writing is superior, the direction is fantastic, and the way the story builds is slow but undoubtedly engaging. If Alfred Hitchcock had ever endeavored to create a serial work, it would be something like this.The characters are all lovingly and soulfully rendered, and the show never seems to fall into the traps that even the best anime do - that is: needless fanservice, forced comedy, or ludicrous violence.In addition, get ready for a history lesson.

She's stupid and annoying in those kind of roles.Lucy runs \"Dirt\" and \"Now\" Magazines, and she'll do anything to get her story, including blackmail, betrayal, maybe even someday, she'll resort to murder. That would be fun to see.What I like about Dirt is the way it's shot, it's just beautiful. I also like how Cox's character makes every pathetic little excuse for a human being cry. Her performance is to die for. And, even though I've only seen the pilot, I see no signs of slowing. It looks like it will keep getting better and better.

Rizzoli is a headstrong cop whose Italian upbringing shows through, this is the type of woman you can see growing up with 3 brothers and kicking their ass around the house the whole time. Isles on the other hand is a socialite more of a impressed by the complexity of the world and enjoying every second of the mystery around it.

The boardroom can be entertaining to watch, but it's entertainment at it's low-point - Sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old Jerry Springer episode. The tasks on the show are, at most, boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay NBC for the publicity. And what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6? That is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real-life. I have absolutely NO respect for any of the contestants this season, they all seem like idiots to me. In earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity, now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show. It also seems like Donald Trump's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest, I can't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him. His rationality in the boardroom mostly doesn't make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it's worth.R.I.P The Apprentice.

You can not help but think, what happened, what is the big secret all those people are carrying. There are so many things going on but at the same time it is easy to follow along. You will love it. I can not see them doing more than one season, but hey you never know. This show is a mix between desperate housewives, OC, Tween Peaks, Dexter, and Harper's Island. Can not wait to see more. It has this dark feel about it but at the same time it is warm and makes you laugh at times. Also I think that the casting is excellent: Emily VanCamp - diverse; Madeleine Stowe - chillingly evil, yet you can not help to admire and respect her, Connor Paolo - funny and is going to be one of my favorite. Anyhow i hope this show does well. Watch it!",

    "top_review": "This is the modern take on the Cosby Show. While this isn't as successful it is funny. The thing with the Cosby show was that it was quite realistic. This show has some realism but is generally exaggerated and overplayed for more overt humour. It has more daring portrayals and deeper situations too, with the Kyle's young son taking drugs and also impregnating his girlfriend throughout the series of the show.The key thing that works here is the cast, much in the same way they did in Cosby. This is predominantly a far more modern family, younger parents and wilder children. Damon Wayon's is the father, Michael and he is hilarious. Damon is all about his delivery and is also a great physical comedian. I love Tisha Campbell as Jay, the mother of the household. She looks way to young to have two adult children but you soon forget that. She is vivacious and infectious. Then there is George O Gore as Junior the idiot son. The part is very over the top but funny, with Gore playing the dullard superbly. Jennifer Freeman is very good as the eldest daughter too, and not to mention sexy. The stars for me though are the child cast. Firstly Parker Mackenna Posey as Kady, the cutest sitcom creation since Rudy and the other little kid in the Cosby show. She's a great little actress and some of the lines she has a classic. I laugh almost every time she's on screen and she says something. Kids in these shows can often not have much charisma or can deliver lines well, but she does it excellently. The one that really makes me laugh though is the young genius and future husband of Kady, Franklin played by Noah Gray-Cabey. Every line he is given is superb, because generally he is given lines to say that you would never hear from someone that young. He's also the maestro pianist who serenades his girl with concerto pieces. The trademark line `Anyhoo!' is a gift for the audience that Franklin must utter at least once an episode. It's all funny stuff and lots of running jokes such as the ever more imaginative deliveries of the words `yes' and `no' with dances and palpitations resulting in an answer to a request from the kids. I have found myself doing the same, on one occasion taking a whole 2 minutes to tell my brother that I wouldn't buy him a takeaway.This is a very good comedy show and something I regularly watch. It's been done before but not like this.",

    "top_review": "The short-lived (45 episodes) \"Sports Night\" is available in a six-disc DVD box set. If you're a fan of the show, you know what you're getting. Otherwise, read on...The two biggest questions about \"Sports Night\" have always been \"Will non-sports fans like it?\" and \"Will sports fans like it?\" The answer to both questions is a qualified \"Yes.\"To answer the first query, the comparison I like to make is to \"ER\". \"Sports Night\" is about sports (and television) like \"ER\" is about emergency rooms. You probably liked ER if you appreciated good television drama with interesting characters, whether or not you cared for medical shows at all. Similarly, if you appreciate brilliant television writing and human drama mixed in with witty dialogue, you will enjoy \"Sports Night\". At least a casual knowledge of sports and/or television will aid the viewing process, but neither is necessary.As for the latter question, the target audience for \"Sports Night\" is not congruent to the viewers of, say, ESPN's \"Sportscenter\". If you watch \"Sports Night\" for the sports element, you will likely be disappointed. Most of the athletes referenced are fictitious, and celebrity cameos are non-existent. The sports banter is enjoyable for a big sports nut like me, but the average sports fan probably won't care for this show, much like the average doctor or nurse I know doesn't care for \"ER\".So why is this show both unique and of high quality? Let me count the ways...The writing is the core reason for the quality of \"Sports Night\". Sharp and snappy dialogue largely defines the show, but the fast pace would be worthless without the intelligence of the words. The Aaron Sorkin-led writing team has created a sextet of lead characters, two anchors and four producers of varying responsibility, who are all well-educated and quick-thinking. Their mouths keep pace with their minds, as the dialogue is as fast or faster than real life, and much more intelligent. There are few pregnant pauses for laughter, as a laugh track was used early on but later wisely discarded. The words form a smart, sexy, and funny world, a world that makes one actually long for such a place. Sorkin later gained prominence with \"The West Wing\", which employed the same verbal style that Sorkin perfected during his time on \"Sports Night.\" If you liked \"West Wing\" for its writing, you'll eat up this show as well.Similar to their characters on the show, the actors (at least at the time) were largely unknown by the general public. This enhanced the team atmosphere of both the show itself and the show within the show. Everyone seemed to rely on everyone else in both worlds, and as with many ensemble casts, the anonymity also let the actors become their characters to viewers. Another reason the characters are appealing is that they each have evident flaws and idiosyncrasies. Many of these imperfections are understandable, recognizable, or easy to relate with, further endearing the characters to viewers.Rarely is the editing of a television show noteworthy, but keeping up with the back-and-forth dialogue of \"Sports Night\" is quite a chore. The quick cutting meshes well with the writing. Additionally, the reverse camera angles are a breath of fresh air in a world flooded with three-camera sitcoms. Of course, the question arises as to whether this is a sitcom or a drama or a dramedy. But that's for another place and another time. Unfortunately, outside of the 45 episodes, there is no bonus material on this 6-disc set. The only pleasant touch is the \"Play All Episodes\" option, which allows you to just that with each disc's shows. Since each program is only 22 minutes, you can enjoy a handful at a time without getting off the couch. This is also a dangerous feature, as the addictive nature of the show combined with the absence of commercials entices you to watch hours at a time.It is strange watching a television show without commercials, but this program fades in and out of black where each break would be. That gives enough of a pause in the show for the feel of a commercial, and after the first break or two, not having to watch ads is a blessing. The reason I so highly recommend that you buy the DVD set is that \"Sports Night\" is not broadcast regularly in syndication. You can find it sporadically on Comedy Central, but not at any sane hour. So get the box set because of the show's rewatchability. It doesn't quite contain the memorability (I'm inventing words everywhere) or pop culture labels of \"Seinfeld\", but it does have a similar ability to entertain time and time again.Bottom Line: If you appreciate a truly well-done TV show, particularly in the writing department, get and watch the box set. You won't regret it.",

    "top_review": "I'm a big fan of the original Twilight Zone, and just as big a fan of this reworking of the 1960's anthology series. My family was thrilled in 1985 that the series had been resurrected. We watched it faithfully every week, no matter what strange day or time slot CBS moved it to and they moved it around to a new time slot each and every week it seemed. It was not a retread of the original show but an updated, modern incarnation that stood on its own. It featured amazing shows which were adaptations of short stories by acclaimed writers. In the wasteland of 80's TV it stood out for its ingenuity and originality. Alan Brennert's \"Her Pilgrim Soul\" was, for me, the single best episode produced for weekly series TV since the original went off the air. For my husband it was \"Profiles in Silver\", a \"what if?\" for JFK fans. \"Nightcrawlers\" was a true imaginative nightmare that no one forgot once they watched it. \"A Message from Charity\" is the second favorite episode for most of the people I talk to. But with the network moving the show around to different days it became hard to find in the listings, and people gradually stopped looking for it because it was too difficult to keep track of. In short, CBS never gave this series the chance it deserved, and it sank into oblivion where the final insult was badly butchered episodes thrown into a syndication package. But despite this the series refused to fade away in fans' memories.Finally, the first two seasons and the syndie third season (which for the most part is completely forgettable) are out on DVD. They are virtually uncut; some music has been replaced, and there are a few other anomalies. These wonderful stories haven't been seen in their entirety since the series aired over 20 years ago, until now. There are commentaries by Alan Brennert, Harlan Ellison, Phil DeGuere, actors, directors, writers, etc. This is a must-have for all fans of the Twilight Zone no matter what incarnation, and Night Gallery as well. In many respects this show is a blend of the spirit of the original Twilight Zone and Night Gallery; it uses quality stories by many of the classic sci-fi and horror writers of the past forty years. TV in this new millennium is a wasteland of garbage and nauseous reality TV, and we could use stories and writers like this today. The 1980's Twilight Zone deserves to be seen as the classic it is, and this DVD release does it justice.",

Larry David, in his great comedic brilliance, is not trying to glorify himself with this show, you can tell that just from watching one episode.  Instead, he is really utilizing a caricature of a rich, whipped, neurotic yuppie to skewer the image of life at the top.  His character (even though he is essentially playing himself), bumbles, complains, talks himself into painful situations, and is ultimately served devilishly funny comeuppance from episode to episode.  This self-deprecating humor wouldn't work for anybody else, but for a guy like Larry David, this material works perfectly, because he seems so easy to laugh at (and I have a feeling this is hardly accidental, which is why his comedy is truly brilliant.)  I really have to marvel at the idea of anyone NOT being able to laugh at this show.  It's the greatest comedic take on life and the human condition that has ever been captured on film.  All other television comedies of this era pale in comparison.  \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is possibly the salvation of true comedy TV, in an age when good television comedies are few and far between.",

You come to expect her to crash and burn in a tragic and comedic fashion. Yet in the end, she claims small victories of enlightenment that put all of us in touch with our humanity and teach us a little bit about growth. The show is not preachy, yet makes its points poignantly and powerfully. I'm excited with anticipation as to where the show may go and hope it is renewed despite the poor ratings so far.

I think it's because it seemed to be an amalgam of some of my favorite TV shows of the past. This includes \"The Equalizer\" (righting wrongs using unconventional methods), \"Mission Impossible\" (the TV series)(putting a great team together to work towards a common goal), and \"Banicek\" (solving seemingly perfect crimes).What I really like about it is the team. It is made up of very independent individuals who are master criminals. The key is how they have been enticed to work for Nathan Ford (Timothy Hutton's character). They all contribute to the cause and, because of it, find they are a very powerful force that can get them more of what they are looking for. There is also a camaraderie that I haven't seen in a long, long time.What I also like about this show is that it is not dark and seedy. While there is violence, it is not gratuitous. And, so far, there have been no plot lines that involve stalkers or other misogynistic individuals. One can only hope it continues that way.While there are great special effects, great sets, great actors and great acting, etc., I find that it is the writers who deserve the lions share of praise for concocting such an enjoyable storyline.I am REALLY looking forward to more \"Leverage\" episodes! 10 out of 10",

And Kate Walsh is even better now that she is in her element with actors and characters who are her age, and act like it. Grey's Anatomy's story now seems immature, and repulsively similar to high school in comparison to Private Practice's adults in their late thirties/early forties who are fed up with the crap of relationships. These characters have been divorced, been broken up with, and are looking for something of substance and meaning to add to their lives.Yes, the individual episode format of medical conflict is similar to that of Grey's Anatomy. But more than just surgery plays its part in this show; therapy, alternative medicine, pediatrics and simple family medicine can be just as complex as surgery; often more-so since the patient is conscious and often fuels the issue with their personality problems.So give this show a chance. The cast is great and the storyline is much more mature than Grey's Anatomy. If you don't try it, you won't know if you like it.",

It's easily her best work since Seinfeld, and that's no put down of her post Seinfeld work.

    "top_review": "This is clearly a show that some will appreciate and others will not. After reading some of the other reviews, maybe I like this show so much because I have never watched GLEE.I think some reviewers have missed a couple things. First, this is not just a parody/homage to great horror movies. It is a parody of bad horror movies. Second, you're not in the real world anymore. You're in Slasher Universe, a universe of 1-dimensional characters, bad dialog, silly plots, terrible decision-making, and all the other horror conventions we've come to know and love. That this series of events could not possibly occur in the real world is exactly the point. This universe, while superficially similar to ours, operates very differently. It is populated by dumb jocks, corrupt or incompetent authority figures, earnest if clueless parents, killers in grotesque costumes, and of course SCREAM QUEENS. This is a show about clich\u00e9s and conventions. If you have watched 3 slasher films in your life, then most everything in this show will seem familiar to you. To me, the silliness of the humor makes it more enjoyable than some of the poorly acted and directed movies that it satirizes.",

Kappa House, the most sought-after sorority for pledges, is ruled with an iron fist (in a pink glove) by its Queen Bitch, Chanel Oberlin (Emma Roberts).

Guess having one of the lockups shrunken and stationed in the helicarrier headquarters of the counter-terrorist group SHIELD was a BAD idea. In future episodes, other heroes will enter the fray like World War II superhuman patriot Captain America; unconventional archer Hawkeye and African monarch/combatant Black Panther. Bring on the good and bad guys! Though it won't surpass the monolithic \"Justice League: The Animated Series\" from long-time competitor DC/Warner Bros Animation, \"Avengers\" joins recent Marvel Comics animated shows \"X-Men: Evolution\" and \"The Spectacular Spider Man\" as good quality productions.

I feel like failing on my knees and thanking the TV gods that AMC made the shift into television, because BOY do they do it right. What's so refreshing about this series is the glimpse it gives us into the daily lives of regular citizens on Long Island attempting to negotiate their lives during this turbulent period in our history. Stories of this era often focus exclusively on the political figures and the generals involved. These are people who have grown up together and in many cases been driven apart due to the respective sides they've chosen in the conflict, Tory vs Patriot. There are no real villains in this equation, since it's possible to make a good faith argument both for the rightness of maintaining allegiance to the Crown and the rightness of seeking independence due to unjust treatment. It's fascinating to watch these political allegiances play out within the context of relationships, impacting friendships, romantic couplings, even family relations. The spy angle is intriguing, well integrated into the story, and hooks you from the start. The acting, directing, cinematography, as so often with AMC, all top notch.

    "top_review": "I have to say, as a BSG fan I wasn't exactly sure what I'd think of this show. I saw it on the big screen at the Arclight cinema tonight (as part of the Paley Center screenings), and the cast and film makers spoke after-wards. Ron Moore said they 'wanted to make a clean break from Battlestar, and do something different, and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they'd gain others\". Even without their talk, I am now a fan of the new show. But here's what I thought of the film.I loved it. It was really very good. I guess I'm a true sci-fi (or 'syfy' - do I really have to type that?) geek, because I'd totally watch this as a series. It has a strong and rich story, and kept my interest. It starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something, which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing. The actor playing \"Ben\" should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs. The actress playing \"Zoe\" seemed a little posy, but she was playing a teenager (and I'm sure I won't be the only one who thought \"Zoe\" was a cylon at first, perils of being a BSG geek). If they're hoping these will be the new Bamber/Helfer/Park, they may want to rethink it. Surprisingly, it was the adults that captured the audiences attention.Eric Stoltz gives a stellar performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and doesn't let go. He does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character's sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters, traps her, then dismisses and releases her. No sign at all of the 'serial killer' he played on Gray's Anatomy, really impressive acting.Equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is Paula Malcomson as his wife Amanda Greystone. She is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as Stoltz's part, and I completely believed that they are a couple, and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship, something rarely seen these days. I look forward to seeing what happens with this family, and hope they give her as much to do as Roslin in BSG- she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid, you cringe, it's really great. Not to mention her eyes, which could hold magical powers, that's how intense they are. The scene where she takes on the government agent- very short scene, but beautifully played- really gives you an idea of her power.The other part of the show that did not work 100% for me were the scenes with Esai Morales, and the mafia type clan of his. He does a good job overall, but I did not believe in this mobs power, nor intimidated by their threats. I found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out; the way it is presented is almost an homage to the Godfather, they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit. But given time, I can see how this will develop into an interesting 'Upstairs/downstairs' kind of thing, with the poor minorities (Morales et al) versus the rich folk who rule the planet (Stolz et al). And to be honest, I did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name- that was a very well played scene.Note to BSG fans, the boy playing 'Willy Adama' doesn't really look much like Olmos, but he's just a kid. Whether or not he'll be featured any more than he was in this film, who knows? I sure couldn't tell. But it didn't bother me, because he wasn't as interesting as everything else going on around him.Polly Walker plays 'Sister Clarice', and she's chilling and odd in every scene she's in. I'm not sure where she'll go or who she'll end up with, but I was very impressed with her acting. In this film she was sort of on the side, but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on. She was nothing like her character in \"Rome\", something I always find impressive in actors.One nice surprise- the music is actually better and less obvious than BSG, even though it's the same guy doing it, Bear McCreary. It has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise, I'd buy this score if I had the chance.As to the 'panel discussion' after the show, it was hosted by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very smart and articulate, David Eick was cracking wise (much like his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was cast, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and didn't really answer the questions ( but I've always had a thing for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she took Seth Green to task for mistakenly saying she was on '24'), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were both darling. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were there as well, answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on BSG. Overall a very interesting and wonderful evening.I'm giving the show a 9 out of 10, and very much looking forward to watching it all unfold.NOTE: I just watched this a second time and really hope they explore what the HOLOBAND was originally made for. I have no idea what that may be, but it holds a great deal of fascination to me.",

The drama gets more intense and much more interesting, and while it does, a mystery is being solved. I do think that the controversy surrounding this show is a bit ignorant. People think, \"Oh, why do all the maids have to be Latina?\" like as if it's really trying to exaggerate the fact that \"all maids are Latinas\" or vice versa, or the fact that all Latina women can only land stereotypical roles like being a maid. Have we not grown from thinking this way? Can we not just enjoy the fact that they have a show, with an all Latina cast, that is very enjoyable to watch? I think we have all risen from the ignorant, one-sided thinking of \"all Latinas are maids\"...or at least most us should have. This is a fun show to watch and follow. It shows that Latina women, even with being a maid, can be devious, have another side to them, have excitement in their life. They are not your Latina \"stereotypical\" maids. This show breaks the ties from your \"stereotypical\" Latina maid, it helps you realize that there are all different types of Latina women, and different types of maids. I'm pretty sure people don't think of all French maids as White, blonde women with short uniforms that always carry a feather duster around, so why not help break away the \"stereotypical\" Latina maids thought process by having a show that does just that. These characters have great minds and it's great to see a show with more than just only white people as the main cast (no offense). It's a nice, new change of pace. Why can't we all be happy that Latinas are getting more recognition, they are ruling a whole TV series in a \"White-dominate\" Hollywood. Yes, there are many multi-cultural actors and actresses in Hollywood, but have you seen a show where the main cast are all one culture that is not \"White\", or a movie? People have also commented \"why can't they be lawyers or doctors, why do they have to be maids\"? So only doctors and lawyers can be devious, be intelligent and have interesting lives? Are maids not allowed to have these personalities and traits too? Are maids only supposed to clean and that's all there is to them? This show is breaking boundaries. It shows Latinas have all different types of struggles and problems, not just the \"cross the border, get a job, find a home and hope you don't get deported\" struggle that every other show depicts. Why do we always have to find some type of controversy involving everything? All of these actresses have been successful in various roles that aren't maids, so how is this showing that Latina actresses can only land stereotypical roles? Watch this show with interest, not skepticism on whether or not this show is \"racist\". I highly enjoy it and hopefully, you will too. I will be following this show to the end, because I love the show, the script, and the plot, whether or not the cast is all White or all Latina.",

    "top_review": "The pilot episode for ABC's new crime show \"Castle\" left me wanting more, much more in fact, and that is exactly what a good pilot should do. The relationship formed between the two leads is unquestionably one of the best and is, so far, most endearing. It is impossible to not like them.I'll start with Nathan Fillion(of \"Firefly\" fame). Nathan plays Richard 'Rick' Castle. His charm and wit and spot-on comedic delivery make him alone the reason to tune in each week. Move over David Boreanaz 'cause Nathan has got you beat in the plucky-comedic-male-sidekick-to-tough-and-serious-female-cop role. Nathan comes off as the friend we all want and treasure. Having followed Nathan's career rather closely I am glad to see him in this role. It fits his nature and you can tell he knows it too just by watching him. It's in his postures and mannerisms and facial expressions. I believe he said in an interview that he is \"72%\" this character and that sounds about right. He is comfortable in this role. Similar to how he was comfortable when playing Malcom Reynolds in \"Firefly\"(which, by the way, is the greatest show of all time...period).Then there is Stana Katic, who plays Detective Kate Beckett, and God is she gorgeous and enticing. No wonder Nathan's character can't get enough of her. Stana manages to instill in the portrayal of her character enough grit and fortitude to be mysterious and alluring, while retaining a good amount of the audiences confidence in her ability to be a bad-ass. On the other side, though, she is beautiful and her lightly-flirtatious nature does not detract from the other part of her character but rather enriches it making her feel real rather than just a clich\u00e9 tough female cop(because TV is full of them right now).What it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is chemistry and these two have it. They are a joy to watch even when they are not in scenes together and that is what will keep viewers tuning in each week. This show has great promise.Before I go I will note that it was nice to see real authors on the show(I will not reveal who). It adds another layer to Castle's character and makes for an amusing poker scene. I hope the producers arrange for more cameos of this nature. Done.",

He has a secret agenda though and no one knows exactly what it is. He offers his expertise and connections to the FBI, to help catching some of the world's most dangerous criminals and terrorists (=The Blacklist). There is a condition and it is a strange one: He only talks to Elizabeth Keen, a young FBI profiler.The main character is played by James Spader with an earthly style and confidence. He is really good in this. Not an over-the-top performance, with too much sarcasm like the usual mastermind villains in movies or series. He is succeeding to put a tone of regret in his character and that's make him likable.Megan Boone is OK as the rookie agent, Diego Klattenhoff is very good too.The production is looking good, the pacing (a very important factor in TV series) is great, and so far the plot works fine.

    "top_review": "When I first saw the trailer for Copper, I figured it would be like a continuation of 'Gangs of New York.' How wrong I was. Though the setting of Copper mimics that of 'Gangs,' it goes further beyond into the seedy underbelly of the Five Points. It focuses not on revenge or the Civil War, but rather what problems plagued the detectives that tried to keep order in a lawless town.On its own, Copper is a unique perspective on how justice was done in America. Essentially, the show is about Kevin Corcoran, a detective in the Five Points who stops at nothing to get his man, even the ones that think they are above the law. He relies heavily on his partner, Francis Maguire, during the inevitable trouble that follows them wherever they go. Kevin also invokes the help of a black doctor, Matthew Freeman, whose brilliant mind helps the detectives identify certain characteristics of victims that will lead to the killer. But their relationship is tricky due to the fresh wounds that are present from a recovering nation after the Civil War.This show is not at all shy or subtle in its approach as to how things were back then. From the issues of race, class, peer pressure, and the common practice of child prostitution, nothing is left untouched by Copper. This show is certainly not afraid of offending people and you know what? That's what makes it so good to watch.Tom Weston-Jones commands the screen from the first glance and refuses to let go as we are introduced to more characters. He gives an air of mystery and respectability to his role as Kevin Corcoran. He and his co-stars are able to carry the load of heavy scenes that might otherwise make viewers uncomfortable in an understated way. The fact that the bulk of them are complete unknowns (at least in America) allows the audience to watch without any preconceived notions about what to expect. Overall, I really liked the pilot. It has serious potential as it was able to balance a certain number of characters with intertwining story lines that make sense. It would be easy for the writers to back away from the uncomfortable situations that the characters get into, but I hope they don't. The raw talk and bold themes are what make this show unique.",

I found it very amusing on first viewings, but as time wore on, I began to like it more and more, and to eagerly borrow taped episodes from friends, and to hunt for re-runs on syndicated channels.Of the two comedy TV series in the history of television, I would choose both Seinfeld and Monty Python as the cultural landmarks of the medium. In Seinfeld, there is not a trace of sentimentality and glib moralizing that plagues the American sitcom genre. Characters do not hug each other on Christmas, fall in love, wax on and on about family and friends, there is no faux-cathartic season ender so favoured by the writers of, say, \"Friends\".Instead, we have the narcissistic Jerry, constantly mining the minutiae of everyday detail for every bit of situational comedy; we have the hyper-aggressive Elaine, whose strings of breakups with boyfriends are as impressive as her petty neuroses leading up to the breakups themselves; the ultimate schlub-loser George, who lies to every single woman he dates, sells faulty equipment to the handicapped and muscles off women and children when fleeing an apartment fire; and the impossibly inventive physical comedy of the entrepreneur cum schmooze Kramer.Over and over again, week in and week out, the quartet discuss trivialities with unbridled zeal, as the non-descript narrative pings from one mundane setting to another. Seldom has such wit been generated by such gargantually pointless human endeavours. That is where the brilliance of Seinfeld lies, in the ability to go to the most bizarre ends to fulfill the potential of a less than hopeful comedic premise; and the endless, pointlessly smug and nihilistic banter that almost invariably escalates into some of TV's classic lines, such as when George shouts triumphantly after winning an argument that \"there is no bigger loser than me!\".Surely, we won't find something like this again, for many more years to come.",

Unique shows like this do not fair well on television. It lasted 3 seasons and this first season was one of the greatest first seasons that any show could ever produce. People might have been turned off by too much sci-fi or romance, but i thought they did a great job of balancing the two and it is a shame not enough people watched this show. The chemistry between Behr and Appleby and Fehr and Delfino was just great. They are all great actors. The romeo and juliet aspect of the show was very unique and rare for this age of TV. I first saw this show in 99 i was 17 and could relate to the characters very well, alien part aside. This show can be enjoyed by people of any age or gender. I highly recommend buying this show on DVD even if you never seen it before its well worth it. People afraid of the sci-fi part should know the aliens are just like humans no green skin or big eyes. They just simply can do things normal humans cant. The first episode Max (behr) heals Liz (appleby) after she is shot and their lives are changed forever. They both fall in love from their and their problems also start because now the sheriff and FBI start to suspect something isn't right about Max.The alien part of the show is what causes a lot of problems that are impossible to have on other teenage dramas, which is why its unique. Katims who is the creator behind the show is just a genius. So again I highly recommend this DVD set. The second and third seasons will be out soon enough.",

    "critic_rating": "7.6", 
    "top_review": "Whenever I mention watching Gummi Bears, people can't help making the oh-so-witty comment \"Huh? You actually watch a show about little candy bears?\" \"No,\" I patiently explain, \"They are not the candy. They are Gummi Bears, members of an ancient medieval civilization with advanced technology, culture, morals, history, traditions...\" By that point whoever I'm talking to has usually raised their eyebrows and started to back away slowly, or to laugh.But it's their loss, because the Gummis are anything but little candy bears. This show goes further than any other Disney Afternoon show that I've seen in truly developing a whole mythology and culture that the viewer can actually learn from, while watching witty and entertaining plots involving adventures around the kingdom of Dunwyn. The show revolves around the Gummis of Gummi Glen, which used to be the center of a thriving Gummi culture that coexisted with humans, until the humans began to clash with the bears forcing them to flee overseas. A few were left behind in hiding, however, with the duty to protect the kingdom of humans from greedy people who might want to take it over (eg Duke Igthorn, a bitter exiled Duke who covets the throne), and to keep Gummi Glen functional until the other Gummis can return, at a time when humans will once again accept them without conflict. At the time of the show, the group living in Gummi Glen is composed of: Gruffi, the practical and cynical one who believes in hard work, living each day \"the Gummi way\", and not going out of his way to help silly humans (although in the end, he'll always go along to help); Grammi, whose work as the woman of the house cooking and cleaning and mending clothing hides an adventurous and daring nature; Zummi, the absent-minded and wise keeper of the library and ancient Gummi wisdom, including magic--which he is forever screwing up, in a truly endearing way; Tummi, whose name reveals his great love of food, although he also loves to garden and work on various crafts projects, and who has a patient and generous nature, sometimes to the extent that he can't say no to anything even when he should; Sunni, who's energetic and romantic, always dreaming of being a princess, but at the same time she's spunky and determined, and learns a lot as she grows up; Cubbi, who dreams of becoming a great knight and defending justice, and also just loves to play and to annoy Sunni; and finally Augustus, aka Gusto, who joins them later and doesn't live in Gummi Glen--he's an artist who doesn't believe in living life by strict rules and discipline, and so of course is constantly on Gruffi's nerves. In addition, there's Calla, Sunni's best friend, the princess who would rather be a tomboy or a knight, and Cavin, Cubbi's best friend, a page at the castle.So that's the basic cast, plus a few others. Every character is multi-dimensional, and in particular, the development of their relationships is fascinating and complex and often touching. But in addition to the individual characters, the whole Gummi culture is well-developed and interesting. They are more advanced than the humans of their time, with wisdom and technology that the medieval humans have lost, now that they're in this era of rejecting the Gummis as silly myth. There are Gummi holidays and traditions, as well as sayings--my favorite of those being: \"Though the first step is the hardest, and the last step ends the quest, the long steps in between are certainly the best.\" And of course the spells are great, with poor Zummi never picking up on the simple language they're written in. (One funny line is when Zummi's trying to create a small tornado, and misreads his paper: \"Wumind Blumow Humere!\" And then as the tornado suddenly starts up right under him: \"I mean, Thumere!!\") There are other centers of Gummi culture other than Gummi Glen, such as Ursalia, an ancient deserted city now inhabited by \"Barbic\" Gummis whose culture conflicts with the Glen Gummis' ideas of civilized culture, and also Gummadoon, the city that's under a spell to reappear for a day every hundred years. And of course, there's Gummiberri juice, the juice made from the secret recipe that allows the Gummis to bounce around, and makes humans extremely strong--hence it had better not fall into the wrong hands!But not everyone will find a made-up culture of colored bears all that interesting. Even if you don't, the shows are well worth watching simply for the wit and entertainment of their plots and character interactions. The dialogue is sharp and amusing, the background music is charming, and the plots are sweet and entertaining. In my opinion, this is one of Disney's most intricate and well-developed and truly endearing shows. Highly recommended to anyone of any age who's willing not to be cynical about it.",

Possessing powerful magic and advanced technology, this race coexisted with humans until the growing rivalry forced the Gummies to flee across the sea, leaving only a small caretaker colony to prepare for a possible return. However, generations passed and the colony forgot their purpose even as human knowledge of the race faded into mere legend. All that changes when the colony meets a boy with a Gummi Bear medallion which unlocks the Great Book of Gummi which reveals lost knowledge of their past. Now the colony has dedicated themselves to the new goal to rediscover their heritage with the help of a few trusted humans while preventing new enemies like Duke Igthorn from exploiting that heritage to their own ends.",

Regardless, I've been trying to recruit as many friends and family as I can - particularly \"24\" and \"LOST\" fans - as Persons Unknown has given me at least one reason to look forward to Mondays.Created by Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects, Valkyrie), this show provides non-stop suspense while keeping you in the dark plenty enough as to WHO is watching these poor folks attempt to keep their sanity, among other things. As a couple of other posters alluded to, I also was worried after weeks one and two if the show would be able to keep providing adequate suspense. After watching episode 5 tonight, the answer is a resounding yes: one could almost argue that there is an overload of questions for the viewer. That is not a problem that I mind, and each week has built on the last, making the show stronger as it progresses.If you have not checked out this show yet, it's not too late, but at the same time, catch up if you can. It'd definitely be worth your while to see why this bizarre town is about as creepy as the woods from The Blair Witch Project and the island of Lost combined into one.",

Not too many. This show was definitely very close to the games, the plots were interesting and fun, and it was always great to see Ash catch a new Pok\u00e9mon.the 1st 9 Seasons were great so let's start with Season 1 The show stars Ash Ketchem, a 10 year old who starts his quest to become a Pokemon master. Along the way he gets Pikachu, Misty and Brock and fight against Jesse, James, and Meowth, AKA Team Rocket.the Kanto saga/Season 1 was by far the best it has a great plot and nostalgic Pok\u00e9mon battles Pikachu was cute, Brock was cool, Misty was hot, Team Rocket was funny (but now became one of the worst and one of the most annoying villains ever during season 3 to season 13) the 1st episode was the best Pok\u00e9mon episode to date and thats where the Pok\u00e9mon story begins but too bad team rocket was not in the 1st episode until the 2nd episode the Pok\u00e9mon theme song from season 1 was one of the most memorable theme songs everthe 2nd Season was GreatThe Johto Saga was Good but Not Great as Season 1the Hoenn Saga and the Kanto Battle Frontier Saga are Decent&Okay but it has a Few Problems but things went way Downhill as the Diamond and Pearl Series Startedand then it just got Boring, Repetitive. The same thing happened over and over and over again just with different Pok\u00e9mon/characters.I guess they were running out of ideas? Honestly most of the great shows went downhill if they run for too long. after the Diamond and Pearl series there was a new Pok\u00e9mon series Called Pokemon Best Wishes/Pokemon Black and White but i never watched them because it won't be the sameoh well Pok\u00e9mon is still a cute show and its not worse then dinosaur king Pokemon is one of the Greatest Shows of All Time, but not Phineas and Ferb nor Littlest Pet Shop 2012I'm a Pok\u00e9mon fan I like this show, the video games, and toys and everything. way better than Littlest Pet Shop 2012, Way Better than Pac-Man and the ghostly adventures and Way Better than Phineas and Ferbbut this show is probably alright for kids age 5 to 12 or if you're born in the 90s but it can be hard to watch if you're older.if you're new for Pokemon watch the very first Season of Pokemon or play The Pokemon games on Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS Insteadif you stopped watching Pok\u00e9mon after season 2 or if you stopped watching Pok\u00e9mon after season 5 try Digimon (Season 1&Season 2&Season 3) or Medabots or Yu-Gi-Oh! (the Original was Better) or Power Rangers (Mighty Morphin, Zeo, Turbo, In Space, Lost Galaxy, Time Force, Wild Force, Dino Thunder, SPD, Mystic Force, Operation Overdrive, Jungle Fury, RPM, Samurai) instead",

And without any modern technology, who can tell us why? Now, 15 years later, life is back to what it once was long before the industrial revolution: families living in quiet cul-de-sacs, and when the sun goes down lanterns and candles are lit. Life is slower and sweeter. Or is it? On the fringes of small farming communities, danger lurks. And a young woman's life is dramatically changed when a local militia arrives and kills her father, who mysteriously - and unbeknownst to her - had something to do with the blackout. This brutal encounter sets her and two unlikely companions off on a daring coming-of-age journey to find answers about the past in the hopes of reclaiming the future.",

    "top_review": "THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW (CBS, 1960-1968) is not only Andy Griffith's first TV show, but his best. Griffith, who made his mark on Broadway, TV and screen adaptation of NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS, might have turned that into a weekly comedy series. Instead, Griffith was offered an original premise about the life and times of a southern sheriff in Mayberry. With the show's opening shows off a father and his young son walking towards the pond with fishing poles carried over their shoulders to whistling score, \"The Fishing Hole,\" it's become one of those rare cases where a series, lasting eight successful seasons, to resume that same basic introduction. There were some minor changes over the years where it converted from black and white to color, and the growth of the sheriff's young son. During its eight seasons, this wholesome sit-com not only centered upon Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith), but on the citizens of Mayberry, North Carolina. Naturally a series with such a lengthy run would go through some dramatic or necessary changes, such as the loss of certain characters, (Deputy Barney Fife), and addition of others (Goober Pyle, Howard Sprague), having one basic show with two different formats.Andy Taylor is described as an easy-going, sometimes laid back sheriff seldom in complete uniform, unlike his bumbling deputy, Barney Fife, who not only dresses accordingly, ranging from tie, hat and a gun in his holster containing one bullet.going strictly by the book of the law. Together Andy and Barney team up for some humorous police work with Andy playing the straight man, and Barney providing his quota of laughs. At times, Barney becomes the bumbling fool in the eyes of the people. It is up to Andy to prove them wrong by helping Barney restore his confidence usually by giving Barney the credit actually due to the sheriff himself. Aside from their professions in keeping law and order in Mayberry, certain episodes would set focus on their personal lives, particularly on Andy, a widower/ father to his young son named Opie (Ronny Howard), cared for at home by his matron Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). The first season to THE GRIFFITH SHOW did find Andy romantically involved with Ellie Walker (Elinor Donahue), the lady druggist. Seasons two and three found Andy sporadically having new love interests. By the time he acquired one in Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut), Opie's school teacher, Andy lost his strong Southern accent for more natural tone. As for Barney, he's a carefree bachelor with his heart set on Thelma Lou (Betty Lynn). Unlike Andy (who would make Helen his bride in the premiere spin off series of MAYBERRY RFD in 1968), Barney would never marry.After five seasons of black and white episodes, the remaining three seasons converted to color. Aside from that change, the Barney Fife character was gone, but not forever, making occasional returns once or twice a year for old times' sake. During Barney's absence, Andy acquired a substitute deputy, Warren (Jack Burns), written out of the show after 12 episodes, leaving Andy to sheriff about town alone and deputy position permanently vacant. With passage in time, Andy's police work would become less frequent, having ts main focus more on Andy's home-life and citizens of Mayberry. Otis (Hal Smith), the town drunk, would eventually be phased out.While normally programs such as this losing a key supporting character such as Don Knotts would suffer in the ratings, THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW continued to prosper for the next three years, becoming the number one show by the time Griffith gave up his badge by the end of the eighth season (1968). By then, the show acquired additional characters to the lineup: Goober Pyle (George Lindsay), Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson) and handyman, Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman), who replaced by Floyd, the Barber (Howard McNear), upon his death during the 1967-68 season; Clara Jackson, later Edwards (Hope Summers), Bee's closest friend; all new characters part of the Mayberry family.What has become the secret to the success of THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW? Was it the father and son relationship between Andy and Opie, (who affectionately calls addresses him as \"Paw.\")? The chemistry between best friends Andy and Barney? Or the now familiar faces and classic characters who took part as citizens of Mayberry that made the show special? One thing for sure, there's nothing dated about THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. It could be set anywhere at anytime, since it hardly dealt with issues or political issues of the day. During its initial years, THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW played funny without becoming too silly, except in some cases with the wild and crazy Ernest T. Bass (Howard Morris). The final years dealt more on serious issues without getting overly sentimental, though some early ones, \"Opie the Birdman\" (1962) and \"Aunt Bee's Romance\" (1964) went strictly on the dramatic side. The final three seasons moved towards a more wholesome, down to earth setting, even modernizing Aunt Bee from homemaker to independent woman acquiring both a driver's and pilot's license, and the teenage Opie having new friends (Johnny Paul and then Arnold), interests in girls and becoming part a rock and roll band. While the Andy Taylor character had been originally introduced in an episode of MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY (1959) starring Danny Thomas, characters introduced on THE GRIFFITH SHOW spawned spin-offs as well: Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors), for GOMER PYLE, USMC, and Sam Jones (Ken Berry) for MAYBERRY, RFD.After THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW ended its run in 1968, it has never gone from view. Many of its 249 episodes in reruns have become favorites, even classics, especially those involving Barney Fife. These and other shows can still be seen and appreciate in its seasonal package on DVD or TVLand. (****)",

    "top_review": "The new shows this fall have almost all been hugely disappointing, starting with the new \"Law and Order: LA\" which proves that the concept of the show is starting to get old, \"The Event\" is yet another bunch of twists and turns that will end in the middle of nowhere sooner or later and the hugely anticipated \"Hawaii-Five-O\" started out strong, but has now taken a turn for the worse, although it's still among the better new shows, which frankly isn't saying much.\"Blue Bloods\", on the other hand, really stands out as a gritty and quite realistic police drama, made by the producers of the hugely successful and dearly missed \"The Sopranos\". Now, we get to see inside the daily lives of a family whose job is to solve crimes, instead of committing them, and thanks to an ensemble of gifted actors, it's quite interesting to see their interactions, both personally and professionally.Frank Reagan is the chief of police in New York City, a man deeply respected by his family and the people he works with. His oldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a homicide detective with a reputation for not doing things by the book, and in the first episode already he sticks someones head in a toilet to get the location of a missing girl out of him. While people admire as someone who gets the job done, he has alienated several people over the years through his views and methods, including his sister Erin (Bridget Moynahan). She is a district attorney, and since Danny often uses unorthodox and even illegal methods to arrest criminals, she has a hard time with convicting them, causing them to argue quite frequently. Jamie (Will Estes) is their youngest brother, and after finishing law school, suddenly decides to become a police officer, much to the dismay of his fianc\u00e9. Although still a rookie, he is approached by a secret society called the Blue Templars, who wish to hire him to investigate the death of his brother, who was a cop himself and was shot while investigating a case.The show comes up with an interesting concept,showing us the interaction of these four family members while investigating crimes and how they often clash in their believes and principles. Donnie Wahlberg's character Danny is probably the most interesting one of the bunch, mainly because it's hinted at that he was in Iraq, and that his tendency to loose patience with the people he arrests is rooted in something he experienced there. It's good to have Tom Selleck back on TV, who is a better actor now than ever, and since I already liked him in the Jesse Stones movies, it's great that I get to see him every week now.You can watch Blue Bloods every Friday at 10 on CBS, and since it's one of the most successful shows that have ever aired in the time slot, it looks like it stands a very high chance of surviving for more than a season, which will be an achievement not shared by too many of the new shows, I'm sure.",

    "top_review": "In brief, this is a cartoon show about a gang of animals--two chipmunks, two mice, and a common housefly--who live together in a tree and solve crimes and have various adventures together. But it's so much better than it sounds from that simple description. The writing is witty with sharp, consistent characterizations, both of the Rescue Rangers themselves and of all the various villains and minor characters. The background music is catchy and the plots are inventive, random, silly and at the same time serious, without being preachy or heavy-handed in giving \"morals\" at all.As for the basics of the show, the Rescue Rangers are composed of Chip--intelligent and determined with a streak of mischief that only occasionally surfaces; Dale--goofy and often trying to prove himself, and also to bring out Chip's goofy side; Monterey Jack--worldly and generally in control of the situation, except of course when it comes to cheese; Gadget--brilliant and absent-minded and sometimes startlingly wise; and Zipper--plucky and enthusiastic and loyal. But all of that can be found in any summary of the show; it doesn't capture what is so great about the show. None of the characters are even close to one-dimensional, and their interactions are complex, witty and fascinating, and can't even be summarized briefly.Just as interesting are the \"bad guys\"--the main recurring ones are Fat Cat and his gang, and Professor Nimnul, a self-proclaimed unappreciated genius. The villains are witty, entertaining, ironic, outrageous, and just plain funny. And in general the show avoids the issue of \"good vs. evil\" directly; the plots typically revolve around the Rescue Rangers thwarting some scheme of a villain to gain power or wealth in unlawful ways (although some episodes don't even have an identifiable villain), but you're not made to hate the villains at all, only to disapprove of their selfishness or greed. In terms of subtle moral messages, I would say that this show shows (not preaches) the value of teamwork, the idea that everyone deserves help, and that selfishness and greed will get you nowhere in the end.But the moral messages are not the main reason to watch this show, although they're important to the charm of the show. I started watching it when I was about four, and it's stuck with me throughout my life, becoming a central part of our family culture even when we go years without actually watching an episode. If a show can be judged by how often it gets quoted or referenced in everyday life, then Rescue Rangers has been the best and most important show in my life. So many of the lines and references have worked their way into my regular vocabulary, lines that are witty or clever or insightful or just plain funny. So often my dad and I find ourselves making analogies to RR episodes while having serious discussions. On the surface the plots may seem entertaining but not \"deep\" in a traditional dramatic sense, but believe me, the wit of the plots and characters and dialogue seeps into your thoughts in ways that will surprise you. It's fun and entertaining, and in a subtle way, very meaningful.Overall, I wouldn't be who I am now without this show. I find that it's written with a depth of cleverness, references, wit, and character development that isn't quite matched in any of the other Disney Afternoon shows (with Gummi Bears coming closest). It's funny, entertaining, and deep, and I'd recommend it to anyone of any age who's willing not to be cynical about watching a show about crime-solving rodents. It's more than worth it.",

    "top_review": "I went into the first episode of Girls with pretty low expectations. I figured that it would maybe be another Sex in the City, with some pointless softcore porn here and there, but I decided to try it out. It is now, along with Game of Thrones, one of my favorite shows on television. In fact, when we get a fresh set of shows on the DVR, Girls is always the first show that I want to watch. It is fresh, funny, and also a bit depressing at times. This is definitely not Sex and the City. That show was glamour and lightheartedness. This show, on the other hand, is about that bad experience that lots of people have coming out of college called \"the quarter life crisis\".The tone of \"Girls\" is somewhat dark, cynical humor. It is about four young women out of college a year or so. They live in New York City, but unlike the Sex and the City ladies, they are struggling financially and, overall, they aren't very happy people. There are Sex and the City posters in a lot of scenes, as if to remind you that you are NOT watching that show. Their jobs are deadend-ish in nature, or just plain nonexistent. They have lots of what looks like unsatisfying or awkward sex. There is an undercurrent of disillusionment and shattered dreams with all of the plot lines. Graduating from college and moving to New York City, isn't the world supposed to be your oyster? Since you still have youthful good looks, freedom, and income, shouldn't your 20s be the most fun part of your life? Maybe for some, but that's not how it works for a lot of people. For some folks, either men or women, the years immediately after college are when you find out that the world truly doesn't care about you, or that you don't have the talent to do what you wanted to do. It is when you grow apart from your college boyfriend or girlfriend and wake up one day to find that you have nobody of significant romantic interest in your life. It is when you find out that there are jobs out there that are horribly boring and unsatisfying.I normally get annoyed by the excessive (and often boring and pointless) sex in HBO's original series, but it fits into this series just fine. This show centers around the trials and tribulations of young women in their early to mid 20s, and one problem that they all share is an unsatisfying sex life. Having been raised and gone through college with today's \"hookup\" culture, the men in their lives are lazy. They barely have to lift a finger to get laid and they don't need to be romantic to seduce a woman at all. They have sex and then somebody goes home right after. If you are looking for one big feature to distinguish this show from Sex and the City, I think that this portrayal of modern sex culture would be it. Sex and the City portrayed it as glamorous and empowering for women. This show (and I am not sure if this is intentional) portrays it somewhat the opposite. Hannah has been having sex with her partner, Adam, for a long time, but she barely even knows him. Marnie has a long time boyfriend, but she's not turned on by or in love with him. The relationships that these women have are shallow and unsatisfying.The themes are interesting, and the writing is clever too. The one liners are usually funny. The hijinx are sufficiently wacky and unpredictable. If you have shared experiences with the characters in this show, then I think that you will \"get\" it, and that you will find it funny. If you haven't, then this show might not appeal to you. If you were turned off from the show by its marketing or because you didn't want to see another \"Sex and the City\", then I highly encourage you to give it a look. Especially if you feel that you can identify with some of the characters. As a 38 year old man, I still could, despite being older and, well, male. This show doesn't appear to be too popular, and that disappoints me, because I really want there to be a second season.",

    "top_review": "For anyone who thinks this is close to Psych...you're dead wrong. While both shows take a similar premise, they're so different in many ways. This show does have a man with the ability to spot minute details, but he does so much more, he plays mind games with people, reads their emotions and sets elaborate traps to catch them. Many compare him to Shawn Spencer of Psych, but I would rather compare him to Sherlock Holmes, except more tortured. The pilot obviously takes on a more serious approach than Psych and the dynamics of the show go from cute and funny to deeply disturbing in seconds.It takes your one crime per episode procedural drama with a gifted detective and takes it one step further. Patrick Jane is more self effacing, gets into trouble and is a known fraud. But he isn't mean or intentionally rubs people the wrong way like House(also based on Holmes) or Spencer. He is very soothing, warm, instills trust and seems to get along with people pretty well, from the guy who did it to his team. At the same time, he does like to flex his intellect and power over people and loves to play games to get answers (and yet, so charming when he does so). So it's kind of disarming when you begin to see there are some serious issues with this character, he doesn't sleep, doesn't believe in life after death (and is happy that way), and is actually anti-social with the group. There are further reasons as to his psychosis that won't be discussed. Behind those warm baby blues, warm smile and calming presence, there is a man being crushed to death by very weighty issues.Patrick Jane is a fantastic character, he's obviously brilliant, but a little distant and isn't fond of working with others. As a former faux psychic he seems pretty ready to disable believers. And of course, Simon Baker is a brilliant actor and is the reason I tuned in (I admit I too feared this was a Psych ripoff) and he brings so much depth to this character. When he plays his mind games he always brings a sense of \"I know more than you and there is nothing you can do about it.\" type of amusement and when Red John or death apparates in conversation you see a distant look in his eyes that conveys more than what he actually saying (the psychiatry appointment in the pilot was incredible). He really plays off the layers of Patrick Jane well, pulling some back and when we get a true glimpse, the layers fall back in place. And credit goes to the set-up of Red John as his \"nemesis\" through a copy cat. He and Jane have a very tense meet up awaiting them, but I can wait for that just to experience the chase and the unraveling history between these two.Another credit would go to the incredible Robin Tunney (of The Craft and Empire Records) who was reason number two for watching the pilot. She has had very little to work with in the first two episodes (but her role grew from 1 to 2 so I have faith), but she plays the hard nosed detective with a little more prudishness and distance than I would have expected. How much she knows about Jane and how far they go back is a mystery to me and their dynamic is interesting. She doesn't fall into stereotype and has retained a beguiling sense of mystery. I also appreciate the lack of clich\u00e9d moments \"fraught with sexual tension\" between Lisbon and Jane.And I'd also like to credit Tim Kang- a lovely surprise and I enjoyed his character who really doesn't give a crap about hurting people's feelings or stepping on toes, he just wants to solve the case. Love it and kudos.My only complaint would be explained in the two above paragraphs briefly. I love Cho and Lisbon and hope to get see more of the team (Van Pelt and Rigsby are really cute as well), but I understand this is called \"The Mentalist\" and there is still time to slowly introduce Jane's history with the team and more in depth coverage of these characters. I've only seen two episodes and I think what I anticipate will come into fruition. Overall, this show is well written, well acted, and beautifully shot. I for one have set up a season recording on my DVR and cannot wait for the next episode, yes you can consider me a fan and I hope you head over to CBS.com and give this show a chance. I wish I had more stars to give.",

The only reason I can see casting him is to attract girls who are 14-17 (due to his roles in Potter and Twilight), the problem is, this is not a show for that age group.Jame Bower brings no charisma or charm to the character Arthur, I find myself rooting for Morgana then I do Arthur. Mr. Bower has such a feminine look to him you can't even tell him apart from Guenevere when they do there sex scene.He was a major miscast for the role. If the producers wanted to show Arthur as a spoiled self-centered 16 year old then they should of gotten an appropriate actor. The script for Arthur is definitely written for a 16 year old so I'm not sure why they would get someone who doesn't even look the right age, so basically you have someone who looks like there in there 20's but acts like someone who is 16. It all comes off as very annoying.Other issues the show has is sloppy writing, they don't setup a foundation for the new lore and there scripts are kind of all over the place story wise, they leave a lot of plot holes that never get explained and it seems there trying to cram to much into each episode.The show would probably be a hit on the CW Network for a much younger audience (remove the nudity), but with Spartacus and Game of Thrones setting the bar very high for premium cable shows, Camelot falls short.",

It was described as a \"gritty crime drama\" with many Baltimore locals portraying variations on themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I decided to check out the first season on DVD.After the first few episodes I became seriously hooked and devoted 36 hours of the next ten days to the show.Having now watched the first 3 seasons, I believe it to be the best television series I have seen.I do not understand why this show hasn't generated the buzz or the awards of HBO's other series, such as the Sopranos or Deadwood. It is more gripping, faster paced, and more intelligent. The other shows can be a bit plodding, with plot lines that go nowhere, and a few characters I don't much care about. That wasn't the case here.The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC show Homicide: Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicide side run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling. In tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant.There is no way to avoid having \"the best show ever\" tag sound like anything but silly hype--regardless, what makes this show substantially better than any other realistic and compelling crime or police drama is the fact it is... searching. It doesn't just delve into the individual psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the complex interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks \"what the hell can be done for all of these people\" and points out the problems with any and all of the answers.It's truly brilliant. If you like intelligent television, I envy the enjoyment you will have watching this for the first time.",

    "summary": "Set in Baltimore, this show centers around the city's inner-city drug scene. It starts as mid-level drug dealer, D'Angelo Barksdale beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who's been robbing Barksdale's dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug \"food chain\", from junkies to dealers, and from cops to politicians.",

They're completely missing the point of what makes a show charming.

In the world of Foster's, when kids think up imaginary friends, they become real and can interact with anyone, even adults. But as the kid grows older, they grow tired of their \"fake\" friends. Or, in the case of Mac, a kind, friendly eight year old, parents and older siblings force him to give up his friend, Bloo. So he takes him to Foster's, where he makes an agreement with the staff to allow Bloo to live there without being adopted out as long as he visits him. The show has some pretty interesting characters, while they are not very original, are voiced and animated so wonderfully, it really doesn't matter. Among them are Madame Foster, (the eccentric, adorable old lady who run's the place), Frankie (her granddaughter), Mr. Herriman (Mdm. Foster's stiff, English imaginary friend), Wilt (an extremely apologetic, helpful friend), Coco (in my opinion, the only annoying part of the show), and Eduardo (the shy, Spanish speaking \"monster\".) Eduardo is also voiced by Tom Kenny, a truly talented man who has given voices to dozens of animated characters including BNLT SpongeBob and Heffer from Rocko's Modern Life. This show is very funny, no underlying \"adult\" humor here as far I can tell. My favorite episode is the one with Cheese, Bloo's younger brother. It will have you rolling when he sneers *bunnies*.

Speaking of which, the techniques of speed-up-slow-down have beencriticized in some quarters... They only serve to work the comedy toits fullest.

But the denizens of Royston Vasey set the bar so high that I doubt it will ever be topped.  Half the time you're watching LOG you're laughing because it's genuinely funny, the other half of the time you're laughing because you can't believe what you've just seen.  This series is Stephen King meets the Twilight Zone meets Stanley Kubrick meets Monty Python.  It's easy to be funny, and it's easy to be bizarre and sinister, but to combine them and be all of that at once is truly a feat of genius.  So, providing you've got a taste for the dark and strange, settle down on the couch with a nice glass of \"aqua vitae\" and watch this series.  Oh, and don't take your pet turtle to the vet.",

Even its comedies can be horribly depressing. As I sat watching the premiere of Desperate Housewives, I found myself doing something I haven't done in quite some time, and that is \"smiling,\" No, I mean, a huge smile, a GRIN of thankfulness.I have a theory that most pilot scripts suck, because they are establishing a series, I have hardly ever liked a PILOT script, even if they do their job well which is establish character and the mood of the show. The great story telling comes after the pilot. The only good pilot I have seen in recent years, was the pilot for ALIAS (brilliant) now a week ago, I saw the PILOT for LOST (edge of your seat good). But even those were topped by the intricate, hysterical, amazing pilot script for DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES. If the writers are out there, reading this, 1. Thank You. 2. why are you reading this, get to writing more of this wonderful show.They also have gotten a superb cast of women. OLDER WOMEN! WOMEN WOMEN, not some 20 something year olds with bland looks on their faces and pouty lips! But Talented, amazing, beautiful, WOMEN (and I'm a guy in my 20's) I appreciate that... WOMEN over 40 ROCK! I speak of course of Felicity Huffman, who can do more with one line of Dialogue, than any other actress I know. This show, brings also the RETURN of Terri Hatcher, THANK GOD! It's about TIME!! And it also brings me, MARCIA CROSS, an actress who should have been given an EMMY for her brilliant, heartbreaking work in EVERWOOD last season. The producers/Direction/showrunners of the show, have established a look for the show. it's American BEAUTY on ACID. A gorgeous use of color and cinematography, of scoring, and well, I mention it again, because it's so important... GREAT WRITING!On every level, the PILOT for DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES impresses. It has bite, humor and heart. I hope that it will be around for a long time. But even this one episode is enough to remind people everywhere, that network television can still be FUN!",

It ran for 3 seasons with a total of 85 episodes on CBS from 1995-1999.\"Timon and Pumbaa\" (much like the \"Aladdin\" TV series) was a lot goofier and crazier when compared to the movie it was based on. For example, all of the weird characters. Especially Criminal Quint, who was actually human. Who ever thought we would see a human in a the \"Liom King\" series? But the goofiness does (in some ways) give the show a certain charm, I just really think Quint was a bad idea.The animation isn't so great in this show either. I know their budget is smaller since it's a TV show, but I know they could've done better. Especially since this show was made in the '90s, and there were a LOT of cartoon shows in the '90s with great animation (\"Animaniacs\"; \"Ren & Stimpy\"; \"The Simpsons\"). Also this is Disney we're talking about. The biggest media company in the world! I guess they don't care that much when it comes to television.\"Timon and Pumbaa\" is a decent show though. It was pretty funny, the animation was..... okay, the voice acting was great, and the show was overall pretty enjoyable. However it's not perfect, it is a little too goofy sometimes, and some episodes flat-out sucked.Rating: 6/10 \"Decent\"",

    "critic_rating": "6.9", 
    "top_review": "\"Late show with David Letterman\" is in many ways superior to other talk shows in late night television. Even if Letterman is the main focus, and often tends to act a bit egocentric, he still (or perhaps it`s more correct to say that the writing does) includes many of the crew members in the sketches. This gives the show an excellent flavour of diversity, and make it even more outrageous and entertaining. The writing is very original and innovative, and is able to grasp with current events in a clever, and at the same time, plain crazy way that will make you burst out in laughter.But of course, the most important person is Dave himself, a highly individual host with his own, unique style. He is by all due respect not a very good stand up comedian, and might sometimes seem quite uncomfortable delivering his jokes in the opening monologue, but he is well aware that this is not his strength, and keep it to a minimum, 3 or 4 minutes (as a comparison, Jay Leno`s monologues last for 10 minutes) Also considered harsh, sarcastic and unpredictable, Letterman is not loved by everyone, and these traits might sometimes make him a bit unhuman, but at the same time, his unpredictability is also his genius, and what makes him stand out from his fellowships.His greatest strength is his exceptional ability to ad lib and deliver funny comments to almost any situation, and that is why the writing includes a lot of segments where the camera is capturing the life and people in New York City. In this way, Letterman can easily comment on what he observes and ask silly questions to the people on camera, and the fun will soon appear. Despite his reputation as a bad boy, he is a great ironic, and is able to joke with himself in a way that most comedians can`t. Still, he is just not goofing around all the time, and might appear quite serious when he is interviewing his guests with curios questions, especially those who have something to say.(unfortunately, not many do)The music director Paul Shaffer plays a major part in the show, and functions as Lettermans sidekick with his funny, and some times not very well thought comments(and yes, i agree, he sometimes looks as a parody in his flamboyant suits) Their relationship is extremely established, and their chemistry is also fabulous, so it`s unthinkable to imagine anyone else as the music director. So, if you wan`t to watch a very special and imaginative talk show with a touch of pure genius, \"The late show\" is the right vehicle. And if you haven`t become a regular viewer yet, you better hurry up, because it`s hard to say for how long  David will keep going. By all means, im not a prophet, but i will guarantee you that David Letterman is too unique to be replaced. Watch the show regularly, and you will understand what i mean.",

This is very well crafted, with a impressive camera precision even though it's within the Gritty-style of modern cinema. Here and there you'll see some very inventive camera directing (a motorcycle-crash comes close to the best vehicle-scene I have seen since the first \"Mad Max\"). It is a rough and gray view of mob-crime in a dystopia Italy, but even though the setting is the same ghetto as the movie \"Gomorra\" the social-realism of the movie is toned down by the producers, in order for a more character-driven narrative to emerge - that is good. This is a brilliant authentic-Italian and promising series, that recalls Sergio Leones \"Once upon a time in America\" just without wide angel and widescreen. And again it contains some of the technically best non-computer generated action-sequences I have seen since Michael Mann. BRAVO! Forza Italia! from Denmark.",

But what makes this show different is that it does not have a frantic pace at which things take place. Although, I thoroughly enjoy 'The Simpsons' and 'Family Guy', yet these shows have everything happening at a breakneck speed; the gags, the animation, etc. King of the Hill somehow has a certain calmness to it. It deals with real people (5 fingers, not 4) and fairly real situations. It always puts a smile on my face and it's nice to hear Hank's pearls of wisdom.

Just because of the word \"Digimon\" especially the 'mon' bit, people think that it is immediately a Pok\u00e9mon rip-off.  I happened to have had been one of those people.  I refused to watch Digimon when it started because it sounded like a rip off of Pok\u00e9mon and there was a cactus with boxing gloves on! %( I mean come on, a cactus with boxing gloves thats as stupid as an electric rodent. Anyway I gave it a chance when there was a gap after Pok\u00e9mon finished (and my nephew loved Digimon so I reluctantly gave it a chance).  I ended up loving Digimon as it was alarmingly more adult than Pok\u00e9mon and they had what many people craved... continuity.The Comparisions Digimon follows the story of eight children with their respective Digimon, each with distinctive personalities and traits, working together in heroic situations (many viewers form emotional attachment to the character - I love Gabumon and my girlfriend loves Gatomon) whereas Pok\u00e9mon centres around three kids who catch and train Pok\u00e9mon (no matter what I still love Onix & Vulpix).  Digimon can speak English whereas Pok\u00e9mon can only say their name (excluding Meowth & Slowking - also Lapras can mind link with humans as can Lugia & Mewtwo)  And finally Digimon follows a storyline where the heroes battle evil continuously, learn about themselves and each other.  We also learn about their families, hopes, fears and watch them fight for what is right while Pok\u00e9mon goes along the same line as Digimon but to a lesser extent and rarely does Pok\u00e9mon follow up stories from previous episodes.So all in all, why can't a person still love Pok\u00e9mon but also watch Digimon. You may be pleasantly surprised at how different Pok\u00e9mon and Digimon really are.  After all I watch them both (their on rival channels but Pok\u00e9mon is on half an hour before Digimon... but Digimon is opposite Dragonball Z (what a dilemma!) ;-)",

    "title": "The West Wing", 
    "critic_rating": "8.8", 
    "top_review": "As mentioned in a couple of episodes, Andrew Jackson kept a two-ton block of cheese in the foyer of the White House for the public.  It was to remind everybody that The White House belongs to the people, and that their voice should always be heard and represented.  Well, \"West Wing\" is a love poem to the ideals of a portion of America that has not had a voice in a long, long time. Be forewarned, this show is not a docudrama watered down or dumbed down in order not to offend the sensibilities of the mainstream.  It is unabashedly - dare I say in these reactionary times - ultra-liberal and proud of it.  President Bartlet and his staff represent the spirit, courage, depth and imagination that many (but obviously not all) faithful Americans feel this country was founded on: a spirit that they would like to see in their political candidates, but rarely find anymore.  It is the stuff of dreams.  Check that twice; this isn't reality TV so don't go ballistic if certain \"facts\" about the official processes of White House machinery are incorrect.  The show isn't meant to provide documentation of life in the west wing.  It's meant to give us an idea of the complexities of the political process, as well as a look at the dedication and personal sacrifice most politicians and staffers have to endure.  Most importantly though, the show is meant to be a springboard for ideas and values.  Is President Bartlett in any way realistic?  Hell, no!  He's a wild composite of every liberal politician and scholar that ever positively influenced this country, as well an authority on antiquated history, philosophy, mythology, national parks, chess, and virtually every nation in the world. What makes him especially endearing is that all of these qualities are rolled up in a homespun charm that could make Garrison Keillor positively green with envy. Some people don't seem to get the joke: he has every single element that has been absent in politicians - Democrat and Republican alike - for a longgggg time.  The fact that he is so unreal is THE element of social satire that this program propagates.  Frankly, I find it thrilling because as much as I love other political satires like \"Bob Roberts\" and \"Wag the Dog\", it seems wonderfully refreshing to see satire being directed from politicians rather than at them.  There will never be a real president like Jed Bartlet in the White House, but every American can get a healthy dose of inspiration from fictional Jed Bartlet, 'man of the people'.  [I'd include other nationalities in that statement, but there's something about Bartlet that is quintessentially American.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but I visualize it along the lines of reading the Constitution while eating a bowl of chili.  Other nationalities will have to come up with their own particular mixture of homespun idealism.].  I should include his staff in that statement too, since any of those in the West Wing (with the exception of Ainsley Hayes, sweet as she is) would make a fantastic president.As for the other elements of this show... On first watching it, I was very aware of the fact that the White House staff seemed to spend more time holding conversations while walking in corridors, than actually sitting in their offices.  I was also aware of how the cameras twirled around them unceasingly.  And I often found the dialogue in both quality and delivery to be something along the lines of Spalding Gray meets Gore Vidal; i.e. extremely quick, witty and brilliant, but how many people really talk that way?  Well, by the third episode I became so attached to the fascinating qualities and idiosyncrasies of each character that in my ears, their dialogue seemed to flow quite naturally.  By the forth episode I was tickled pink to follow them anywhere.  And by the fifth episode, my inner gyroscope finally synched up with the show's steadicam. I'm hooked- what else can I say!  All the characters/performers of \"West Wing\" are excellent, and the \"what if\" scenarios in each show cleverly cover situations that we're all familiar with, with just the right touch of emotional depth (or in some cases, levity. The show's humor is always delicious!).`West Wing' is simply brilliant through and through.  The only bad thing about it is when it's over, we all have to face reality once again. Damn!",

It's a shame that NBC has canceled it, and hope they reconsider. There isn't a lot of good TV out there, but, this IS good TV! Could it be better? Absolutely. However, it takes time for actors to get into their characters, develop relationships, and develop stories. I hope that we can watch all of these characters develop for several more seasons.Please don't cancel this wonderful show!",

    "top_review": "I was very apprehensive about checking out the From Dusk Till Dawn the Series, because I really liked the original film and felt that the show wouldn't do justice. This is also because they attempted to do several other films afterwards that were all flops. The difference though between the last couple films and this series, is that Robert Rodriguez(the guy who created/directed original film) is the helmer of this series rather than someone else. The show has proved to be successful with his adapting the film to television. 5 episodes in the series and each one has been nostalgic of the film. What I like about the show is that it follows the original story religiously, but goes into way more detail than it did in the film. I assume things will be somewhat different though from the film before the season is over in order to keep the story going since the series was recently renewed for another season after this one. So far though, the story is building the same way it did in the film, in that the Gecko brothers are on the run after robbing a bank, join up with the Fuller Family by taking them hostage in there RV so that they can evade police and make there way for El Rey. Episode 5 was the best episode I've seen yet. A small synopsis is that The Gecko Brothers and Fuller Family are almost into Mexico, but they need to get past the border checkpoint. This scene is much different than the film though, it that the stakes feel way more dangerous and higher. The story is great and smart, incorporating Wilmer Valderammas character Carlos and Ranger Gonzales who is still hot on the Gecko Brothers trail. All I have to say is by the end of the episode, you'll be wanting to see next weeks. If you've been keeping up with each episode so far, you've noticed little nods to the world of Rodriguez/Tarantino such as The Big Kahuna Burger, Earl Mcgraw's character played by Don Johnson in the series, Seth/Richies mannerisms..etc. If you get the El Rey channel, Netflix, or have internet to download, I definitely recommend keeping up with the series. It is surprisingly an entertaining show to watch on Sunday's.",

These types of reviews have been the same for as long as I can remember.  The periods that people now call \"classic\" frequently met with poor reviews at the time.  One thing to remember is that the show is an hour and a half, longer than most any other TV show.  It is hard to fill such a long show with consistently funny material.  It is also hard to make every episode funny.  Therefore the show (like most shows) wavers between great and awful, depending on the sketch or episode you are watching at the moment.  To judge an entire series on one episode (or part of one) is a mischaracterization.  I've watched SNL for most of its life, and although it has ranged from hilarious to horrible, I would say the average show is \"pretty funny\".

    "top_review": "\"Inuyasha\" is one of the greatest anime that I have ever had the fortune to see. Despite not seeing the very first episodes, reading the manga brought me up to speed since the anime mirrors it very closely. I know there are a few detractors out there, but thankfully they went to the trouble of actually watching it before they started bashing. Hopefully, they'll either warm up to \"Inuyasha\" or find an anime capable of satisfying their exacting standards.The characters are what make \"Inuyasha\" so awesome. Without the characters, the show wouldn't be the success that it is. We start with Kagome Higurashi, a typical Japanese teenage girl --- until she stumbles into an ancient well that transports her back into Japan's Warring States Era. There, she meets a canine-based half-demon named Inuyasha and after shattering the Shikon Jewel, or the Jewel of Four Souls, they have to work together to find the fragments before demons can use those fragments to enhance their own abilities and use them for evil. They largely fail in the whole \"stopping demons from using the Shikon Jewel shards\" deal, because by the time they find a jewel shard, a demon already has custody of it and is using it for evil. So they have little choice but to fight the aforementioned demon and take the shard from him or her once they achieve victory. The funny thing is that Inuyasha initially hates Kagome, as she is the reincarnation of Kikyo, a priestess he loved (until she pinned him to a tree with a sacred arrow). However, he grows fond of Kagome and obviously comes to love her, but he won't admit it to anyone. Things don't get any easier when a portion of Kagome's soul is stolen and used to animate a facsimile of Kikyo's body made from clay, resulting in a rather disturbing love triangle.Then there are the supporting characters, which I'll name in order of appearance. There's Shippo, a kitsune (fox spirit/demon) whose father was killed by a duo of demons called the Thunder Brothers. Next, there's Miroku, a monk who's overly fond of women and has a \"wind tunnel\" in his hand, a void that can consume demons but will eventually consume him. Then there's Sango, a tough-as-nails demon slayer whose family and tribe were slaughtered by Naraku's demons. To add cruel insult to already-grievous injury, Naraku has reanimated Sango's brother's body with a shard of the Shikon Jewel and placed him under his control.Now I have to explain the villains of \"Inuyasha.\" The two main villains of \"Inuyasha\" are Sesshomaru and Naraku. Sesshomaru is Inuyasha's half brother and a full demon, as Sesshomaru's mother was a demon woman and Inuyasha's mother was human. Their father gave each brother a sword; Inuyasha received Tetsusaiga, a sword that can slay a hundred demons in one swing, while Sesshomaru received Tenseiga, a sword that can save a hundred lives in one swing. However, it is only in later episodes that Inuyasha learns how to use Tetsusaiga's powers. Sesshomaru hates Tenseiga, as it is a sword of life and thus he cannot kill anyone with it. He especially doesn't want to save human lives, as he has no respect for humanity at all. Ironically, he uses Tenseiga to restore the life of a little girl named Rin when she's killed by wolves. For being a villain, Sesshomaru is very complex; he's not pure evil so much as semi-evil.Naraku, on the other hand, is undeniably and unforgivably evil. He is the fusion of hundreds of demons and the soul of a human bandit named Onigumo who lusted after Kikyo. He apparently desires the Shikon Jewel, but he may have other reasons beyond the obvious. Naraku's primary skill lies in twisted schemes designed to make Inuyasha and his allies suffer. He started by turning Inuyasha and Kikyo against each other, continued by cursing Miroku's grandfather with the wind tunnel (a curse that would ultimately be passed on to Miroku), and recently orchestrated the slaughter of Sango's tribe. As another person who commented on this anime said, Naraku is the consummate \"supervillain.\"Besides the obvious action, there are also elements of romance-comedy to be found in \"Inuyasha.\" For example, the Inuyasha/Kagome/Koga triangle. Koga is a wolf demon that falls in love with Kagome and declares her \"his woman.\" Inuyasha gets extremely jealous, especially when Kagome is nice to Koga, and yet he cannot figure out why he's so jealous. Then there's the interaction between Miroku and Sango. Miroku constantly gropes Sango and she constantly slaps him for it, but if you read into their actions, it's fairly obvious that they care deeply for each other. If only Miroku would stop groping her so much . . .These are the reasons why \"Inuyasha\" is awesome and if you haven't figured that out by now, then read the manga or rent one of the DVDs. You won't regret it, and if you do, it's your own fault.",

    "top_review": "Bill Cosby had been on television throughout the 1960s and 1970s. His success had been adequate, but far from impressive. By 1984, NBC wanted to have a show that would be endeared not only by minority groups, but also by white America. Enter \"The Cosby Show\", the very definition of a Nielsen Ratings Monster as it devoured competition, along with cohort \"Cheers\", for the better part of the 1980s and early-1990s. The series is basically the life of Cosby with a few creative twists. Cosby, an obstetrician, lives in New York with his wife Phylicia Rashad (an attorney) and their four children (Lisa Bonet, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Tempestt Bledsoe and Keshia Knight-Pulliam). Comedy and drama would always dominate the series, but an early criticism of \"The Cosby Show\" was that it had no real point to it. Enter eldest child Sabrina Le Beauf who was created the middle of season one. This child was away at college and receiving a first-class education at an Ivy League School. And that is the point of \"The Cosby Show\"---two parents doing their best to give their five children the life and opportunities that they have taken advantage of. The Le Beauf character was a culmination of everything that Cosby and Rashad did with the four younger children. As the series grew, the cast grew to include performers like Geoffrey Owens, Joseph C. Phillips, Deon Richmond and scene-stealer Raven-Symone. The greatest problem that most had with the show was that critics said it did not show accurate African-American life in this country. To be perfectly honest, this show does not show typical life for the vast majority of this nation's population. There are not many white children in this nation that have a doctor and a lawyer as parents so that criticism lacks substance and social research. Cosby always kept the show somewhat light-hearted and sometimes shied away from some key issues of the time period, but keep in mind that his name was on the program and everything was written as if the characters were sometimes walking on eggshells. Bonet created the controversy for the series during its run, especially in 1987 with her very adult-oriented role in \"Angel Heart\". That did not deter, but rather engross an even larger audiences tuned in by the late-1980s. Slowly the younger performers grew up and grew out of their roles and the series finally began to show its age by the 1990s. But for a few fleeting moments in the 1980s, was there anyone bigger than Bill Cosby? I think not. 5 stars out of 5.",

Some of the episodes were a bit scary too, but my favorite episode is the episode where Uncle Scrooge and his nephews go to Alaska to dig for gold.  But I must also mention that some of the episodes could be a little cheesy and silly.  The voices are also neat and it makes you laugh many times because it can be a bit over the top.

    "top_review": "I must say, I'm shocked at how much bashing this show tends to get on this site. Personally, I love it! (Sure, a few of the new episodes are kinda...eh) Aside from Spongebob, this show is the pure definition of comedy and one the only one that keeps me, and a lot of other people, tuned in to the Nick channel in the first place. The basic plot is that Timmy Turner is a lonely, misunderstood ten-year-old boy who must deal with more than any boy his age should handle.... Ever. So out of sympathy, he is given Cosmo and Wanda, two bumbling fairies for personal servitude and company from Fairy World. But even with the two fairies at his side to help him 24/7, he quickly learns life is full of complications that even magic can't fix. One of the reasons this show does so well is the large cast of characters. Everyone on the show gets a good laugh from me and that's what's important. Timmy's father, for example, is a clumsy, dense man and always undertaking some stupid task to get back at the... Dinklebergs.... Look up the word \"evil\" in the dictionary and you'll see a mug shot of Vicky, Timmy's babysitter, who cares only about money, the pain of a child, and... well, money. Another reason of this show's success are the plots themselves. To get through life's challenges, Timmy uses his fairies' magic to the advantage. But, of course, nothing ever works out right. One reason is because of the rules added to the power of magic. After all, without restrictions on what Timmy could do, this show would be over in a snap. Also, each episode constantly throws in joke after joke after joke and, coupled with the quick animation and scene switching, it rarely slows down on its humor.Now onto the heart of this wonderful show: the fairies. A regular comic pair. Wanda is sensible and smart, totally opposite of the purile idiot known as Cosmo. Their interactions with each other are often rib-cracking, especially since Cosmo is constantly getting on her nerves to no end. Adding to the fact that they are wed can ensure worse punishment for Cosmo in the end. They're always trying to work together as a team (a horribly dysfunctional one) and help Timmy, but you can always be sure Cosmo will add some \"fun\" along the way. For real people, I can see nothing wrong with this show. Some of the reasons stated on here for its atrocity are total non-sense, such as the animation is bad or the characters all act dumb. Hello, it's a comedy. The characters act like that for a reason. As for the animation, there is worse, such as some of the things on Cartoon Network. (Dexter's Lab, PPG) It, and other shows like it, is actually a revival and tribute of an old style in the 30s and 40s that relied on an abstract look for uniqueness, so it had few details and the characters looked flat. And besides, so what if there's little detail and such? Is that really important in an animated comedy?Alright, enough personal ranting for one day. Back to business. This show is absolutely wonderful. Good, quick humor, a huge and colorful cast of characters coupled with the premise of a boy with (nearly) infinite magical powers make this a must-see show for all. If you've barred this show from your schedule of \"Must-Watches,\" at least give it a good chance. You may be extremely happy with the result.",

I was enthralled by the action and the feats that this man could perform. He had a bionic right arm, two bionic legs, and a bionic eye that could enable him to see great distances.  His strength was more than that of ten men.  He could run faster than a car and he was a super intelligence agent. Along the way he meets a variety of interesting characters and ones that I have never forgotten about.  There was Barney, the seven million dollar man who lets his bionics take over his mind and he uses them for his own benefits instead of that of his agency.  Then there was the probe.  The probe was a machine that was designed to go to space but never made it there.  On Earth, it wreaks havoc and Steve has his hands full with it. Then of course there was Jamie Summers.  She was Steve's girlfriend that has a tragic parachuting accident.  Steve, blinded by love demands that she is given bionics.  She receives them but she has amnesia.  There love is tragically put on hold and it is this plot line that for the first time in my young life, I was taught about the power and tragedy of love.But the best of all the episodes of Steve Austin was the one's centering around Bigfoot.  This also introduced the world to Andre The Giant.  The Bigfoot episodes were scary.  Here is this huge creature that is also bionic and he is a little stronger, a little faster and a little more vicious than Steve Austin.  It is some of the best T.V. I've ever seen and it is one that will have a lasting impression on me for the rest of my life.I remember that I asked my mom how they did all those things.  How a man could jump that high, how he could lift a car and such.  It was then that my parents explained to me that this was all make believe.  That this is what is known as magic.  Well it was from that moment on that the movies and TV captured my imagination.  And for that I will be eternally greatful to The Six Million Dollar Man.",

    "top_review": "Is there really any of us who doesn't suddenly feel nostalgic, with countless memories invoked, at the slight muttering of the words, \"I want to be the very best, like no one ever was\"? For those who lived in a cave, those are the first two lines of the theme song to the awesome anime, Pokemon. Most of us just remember the original Kanto Pokemon (Charmander, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Pikachu...), as the franchise's popularity embarked on a steady decline come the Jhoto Pokemon. Although still relatively popular today, let's face it-- Pokemon was, essentially, a fad.If you were like me, your life was pretty much based on Pokemon at the height of it's popularity. On the bus ride to school, you'd talk to friends about how you were able to catch Missingno. the following night and how your Charizard leveled up to 58. You'd hide your Gameboy in your bookbag during SSR (sustained, silent reading) or free time and play those games. At recess time, It was a rare occurrence you'd hear plain English speak on the playground... it sounded more of a zoo of \"pika-pika!\" and \"meowth!\" that we all just seemed to comprehend. While at home, you'd avidly tear open endless packs of Pokemon cards, then smuggle them to school, as they were illegal, and trade them on the blacktop, drug-dealer style. On the bus ride home from school, you'd secretly do a few more last-minute trades before racing home to catch the Pokemon anime series on the now-defunct Kid's WB. Glued your eyes would be to the television screen, even though you've seen the same episode numerous times and even had it on videotape. You'd eat Pokemon cereal, wear a Pokemon bathing suit, and you jumped for joy upon release of Pokemon: The First Movie. You obviously raced to the theater to watch it, and, of course, loved every second of it.Somewhere after that movie; however, your love disintegrated.Mentality drifted from \"you're a freak if you don't like Pokemon,\" to \"you're a freak if you do like Pokemon\". Pokemon cards were handed down to younger siblings, thrown away, or sold; videos were ripped out and used as streamers; plushies were gifted to the family dog; and the games slowly lost their battery life sitting in your drawer. In many people's eyes, Pokemon were a thing of the past. Others stayed loyal to the franchise.This show/franchise totally needs a comeback. I don't know what's wrong with it now, but a reinvigoration of the craze would be awesome and totally interesting. Ash, Brock, and Misty need to ditch whatever lame friends they have now and just stick together, and Jessie and James need to become again a force to be reckoned with, not just the comic relief characters they are currently. I want to see Pokemon card booster packs being way over priced (I'm talking' 7.99, people!) and impossible to find due to popularity, not lack thereof. No matter how cool you think you are, you know you're at least somewhat interested in this craze making a comeback.The games are great, merchandise is readily available, and there's not much to improve about the cards-- I wonder if the problem lies in the show?",

The twelve episodes capture the political mood of Britain in the early eighties to perfection and in my opinion it does so as good as any serious political observation of that era. What I would say is that although the viewer may appreciate the humour of the series, one really needs to have experienced the early 80's in a full on social sense to get the full impact of what is being viewed. As I was a teenager during the Young Ones era, I not only love the humorous aspects but can also draw direct parallels with the dark and oppressive undertones that are constantly present throughout the series. On the one hand we are in stitches over Viv hitting Rik or Neil and then a moment later we are reminded of the darker elements, which I feel prevailed during this time. Racial violence, unemployment, minor's and teacher's strikes, power cuts, capitalism gone mad, in fact everything that summed up the so-called \u0091Thatcher Era'. And not forgetting the total fear of nuclear attack from the super powers which seemed prevalent during this decade. Wipe the glitz and glamour from the 80's and you are left with a very dark and gloomy time period. The Young Ones acknowledges this brilliantly.  I would say that The Young Ones is just as much a social commentary as it is a comedy and a terrific one at that.",

Well, let me start with the fact that I have 37yrs experience being a fan of the sci-fi, fantasy, action & adventure genres.. I have watched anything & everything worth watching and more than just once! What can I say, I'm a dreamer => I count amongst some great TV shows of the past, Wonder Woman (hint-wish someone would do a present rendition of the show), Dr Who, Star Trek (all of them), The X-Files, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Battlestar Gallactica, V (I hear its getting axed-such a shame!), Heroes, Angel with Jessica Alba (which also launched her as an actor), Xena (she rocked my feminine world & I don't even have one!) all the way to the recently & superbly ended Smallville. Dark Angel & Dead Like Me were good too!! I don't think I need to list ALL of them do I? => The current shows I watch are Sanctuary, True Blood, Fringe & Supernatural to name an important few.. Does everyone remember Catwoman the movie? It was no big blockbuster but it remained true to the theme of the CatWoman.. Having said as much, The Nine Lives of Chloe King could be another good series that develops into an awesome kick ass series about a girl who is growing into Catwoman - just like in Smallville how Clarke grew into the Blur then grew into Superman.. I also think it has the potential and possibility into turning into a brilliant series under the right writers - maybe the writers from Sanctuary and Fringe could be a positive influence - both these shows have enabled themselves to be able to write about anything from the past to the future and back and forth and even sideways now with alternate realities.. All I'm saying is I would love the chance to see this show go somewhere. I have been waiting a very long time to see Catwoman revamped! The lead character played by Skyler Samuels is definitely a good fit and so are the other Mai. Even her annoying quirky friends a slowly starting to grow on me..

Numbers deals with math, House deals with diagnostics, Bones deals with forensic science and great character development for the most part, and Now Tim Roth is the human lie detector. The film is well acted and the chemistry between Tim Roth and his partner is excellent. The dialog is very strong while having slight moments of sarcastic humor. Blunt honesty tends to be very funny at times as well. The writing in the show makes the show seem more on edge as well and I am anxious for more. Lie to me is a wonderful show so far And I can't wait to see where they go with it this season.",

I've always liked HBO's original programming, from Video Jukebox back in the early 80's (before Mtv!), to Taxicab Confessions, OZ, Sopranos, and Six Feet Under. I really had little interest in watching a show about Mormons and polygamy in Utah, but I knew HBO would make it interesting. I love the cast! Bill Paxton is perfectly cast as the lead. He was always an underrated actor. Same goes with Jeanne Tripplehorn as his first (and favorite) wife. Chloe Sevigney is almost unrecognizable as the manipulative second wife, with her long hair and prairie outfits. I first noticed her in Kids. Newcomer Gennifer Goodwyn is quite good as the overwhelmed and lonely youngest third wife. She reminds me of a young Sherilyn Fenn. It doesn't hurt that all of the wives and eldest daughter are quite attractive!One would think Bill's character would be envied, but the more we see into his everyday life, the more I say \"No thanks!\" Imagine dealing with three moody wives and children coming out of the woodwork! Everything has to be written in a daily planner, otherwise things get extremely chaotic. On top of dealing with his huge family, living in three adjacent houses with one back yard, he also has to run a growing chain of Home Depot-type stores, deal with the rest of his oddball family (parents and brother) still living on a polygamist compound run by an evil Harry Dean Stanton who keeps extorting money from Bill and harassing him and his family. Oh, and they also try to keep their polygamy secret from the nosy neighbors, and one of the wives has run up huge credit card debts! Plus almost everyone the family deals with is an over-religious meddler! I also like the relationship with the eldest daughter and her straight laced but good hearted friend, who played Napolean Dynamite's love interest. Overall, I really like this show and hope it becomes as popular as the other great HBO series.",

    "top_review": "You know the funny thing about \"Family Matters\" is that I'm not sure if anyone knows the title of this show, lol, I mean, it just became about Steve Urkel. One of the ultimate characters of the 90's, the kid who made it so cool to act like a nerd. I know Jaleel White hates his type cast now, but he has to admit that not too many actors can do what he has accomplished by creating an icon. No one could ever forget that famous line \"Did I do that?\" or Urkel's attire or his voice.The first season was pretty basic, it was a just a typical family sit com, also a spin off of Perfect Strangers, we are learning about Harriet, the elevator operator and her loving family. Harriet is the mom and loving wife who is abrasive but extremely loving. Carl, her husband and the father, he's a Chicago police officer and is very hot tempered but also has a good heart. Mother Winslow, Carl's mom who has moved in with the family and is one \"hip\" grannie. Rachel, Harriet's sister, who has moved in with her baby, Richie, since her husband passed away. Eddie, who is the eldest son, he's not the sharpest tool in the box, but tries his best anyways. Laura, the second oldest, she's the smart goodie two shoes of the bunch and is extremely popular at school. Judy, the youngest, and the snappiest little girl. Richie, Rachel's son, who is the hot little guy and dancer of the group. And Steve Urkel, the nerd next door who quickly turns into one of the Winslow's.Since the first season was pretty basic and unoriginal, there was only one thing that kept viewers watching and that was Steve Urkel. His crush on Laura, his attire, his voice, his kind heart, his clumsiness, everything about him screamed good ratings. As the seasons progressed, the show became more and more about him, so much to the point where he actually moves in with the Winslow's. The show had a lot of laughs in the beginning and was a lot of fun to watch, I still watch it to this day, I'll admit.There are some flaws along with the show though, they quickly killed off characters that had potential and not to mention the actual family members, like Judy and Rachel. They left the show, Rachel had some reason where she left to help a family member, but she leaves Richie, her son, with the family. Judy just seemed to be a person that they HAD to add into the story, so they just never bothered with her again. The show also got to be unbelievable where they would put Steve in life threatening situations almost every episode. Then they also over did it with Steve eventually turning him from popular into annoying.The main thing that kept the series running was the love story between Steve and Laura, she keeps rejecting him throughout the series. I know there are a lot of Laura haters out there, but I liked her character, she wasn't a bad person, she didn't treat Steve kindly all the time, but they became good friends and I thought she was a good person. I didn't like how the series ended, but I think they were just rushing at that point to end it since Jaleel was getting sick of his character.Whole point being is this was one of the high lights of T.G.I.F.-Friday's night line up. I remember this being after Full House and how much Steve and Carl would make me laugh. The show is a pleasure to watch, just they should have quit while the writers were ahead. Replacing Harriet with a different actress and changing the whole point of what the original story was wasn't cool in my book. But here we are almost 20 years later and still talking about the show, that's gotta say something.",

Downton Abbey was beautifully produced, well cast and interesting, when it was first advertised it looked as though ITV had a hit and from the first episode I think Downton Abbey lived up to that expectation.I for one loved how elegant Downton Abbey was. The photography was beautiful and skillful, while the scenery was breathtaking and the costumes were exquisite. The scoring was also very good, often very hypnotic and beautiful. The direction was controlled, the episodes were well paced and for me the characters were believable my favourites being Violet and Robert.The writing in general was another strength. It was witty in a subtle way, is often funny and could be heart warming and poignant too, the best coming from Violet and Mrs Hughes I felt. The only bit of dialogue that rang false, and this is such a minor criticism, is Robert's \"Downton is my third parent and my fourth child\" which came across as somewhat cheesy. And the stories were well written and as believable as the characters, not to mention pretty original.And of course the acting was excellent. Maggie Smith was perfect as Violet. She plays this sort of character well, and she had such good timing and dialogue. Plus I love her in costume. Hugh Bonneville was dashing, and I cannot get over how beautiful Michelle Dockery was here. Jessica Brown-Findlay was also fine as another of my favourite characters Lady Sybil, and Phyllis Logan was always good value though I would love to see more of her if and when the series returns.In conclusion, Downton Abbey was a wonderful series thanks to the great cast and production values especially and I cannot wait to see more. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

While the first series simply titled \"Dragonball\" went for a somewhat more comedic route, this second series went all-out with the action and drama. Even though the franchise was not intended for kids, even the edited versions of this show were a ton of fun. get ready to power up because this is Dragonball Z Kai.What's unique about the second series is that you get to learn much more about the vague origins of characters like Goku and Piccolo. The storyline is more intricate and the action scenes are a lot more intense (and I mean literally planet-shaking intense). Things get really brutal and everything in sight gets blown away. I love that crap! It makes us all look forward to the next action scenes. Some of the characters are a load of fun too, like the ever awesome Piccolo and the delightfully despicable Vegeta, their personalities and interactions with other characters stealing the show. The villains are pretty cool as well like the sadistic Frieza and the menacing Cell, who instill terror into even the bravest of warriors.What I really like about this series is how dark it gets. In the original manga and the Japanese uncut versions of the show, things get really violent. Even edited, it gets dark with the serious dilemmas and numerous deaths that go around, which makes it more appealing to adults. I guess shows that go this route tend to be pretty successful like that.My only real problems (and they're not really a big deal) is some odd/exaggerated moments and a lot of the screaming. Other than that, this is one of the best action/adventure series and anime I have ever seen. This show is sure to give you one hell of a punch and it's guaranteed to bring out the super saiyan in you. Check it out. KAMEHAME-HA!!!",

    "title": "Frasier", 
    "critic_rating": "8.0", 
    "top_review": "It may have started life as a hopeful spin-off from 'Cheers', but right from the very first episodes, 'Frasier' proved that it had enough style and substance of its own to become a TV legend. Granted, it went on for a couple of seasons too many, and toward the end was clearly starting to suffer from a lack of fresh ideas, but for the most part this was a hilarious, insightful and often very moving programme that my Friday nights throughout the late 90s just wouldn't have been complete without. After so many years of viewing, Frasier, Niles, Martin, Daphne, Roz and Eddie feel like more than just TV characters - they're like your very own neighbours, or even great friends.Indeed, 'Frasier' worked so well throughout most of its run not just because of the sharp, intelligent scripting, but also due to the sheer depth of its central characters and the ongoing focus on their relationships with each other. The characterisation here was always so rich and meaningful, taking us right from Dr Frasier Crane himself, the highbrow, slightly arrogant but good-natured radio shrink, to his more laidback everyman father Martin (a retired police officer now living with his son), and prissy younger brother Niles, a fellow psychiatrist who fits two slots as both Frasier's best friend and his mortal enemy! A lot of the episodes revolved around their family troubles and clashes of interest, but were handled in a very meticulous way, and the morals always felt smooth and genuine. Though rarely quite able to see eye-to-eye with each other, you got a good sense over the course of the series that the Crane men were gradually learning to bond and grow closer together, in spite of their differences. And that's one of the aspects of 'Frasier' that roped me in head and shoulders above its other contemporary sitcoms - it was never afraid to mix heart and poignancy with its laugh-out-loud hilarity. Episodes like 'Martin does it his way', 'Our Father whose Art Ain't in Heaven' and 'Roz's Krantz and Gouldenstein are Dead' are classic examples.Daphne Moon, Martin's amiable English physiotherapist, and Roz Doyle, Frasier's sassy producer, were also great characters who added their own unique streaks of humour and personality to the format. Even Maris, a personage who was never seen but talked about at many an ingenious moment, managed to make her mark - it's to the credit of those wily scriptwriters that they could always have you feeling her presence solely on the word-of-mouth of other characters. On the side, any episode featuring Bebe, Frasier's positively demonic agent, can almost guarantee a laugh-riot - she was utterly hilarious, and there was never another semi-regular character quite like her.In terms of acting quality, the central cast was always strong, particularly Kelsey Grammar, at his utmost prime not just in fulfilling the role of our protagonist, but also in singing 'Tossed Salad and Scrambled Eggs' over the end-credits of every episode (who knew what those words were supposed to mean, but it was a great theme song! I still catch myself humming it from time to time).I'll also come clean with my unswerving admiration for Moose, the canine performer who rounded off the Crane household in the role of Eddie, Martin's Jack Russell, for most of the series (before retiring and being replaced by his offspring Enzo for the final fifth). Seriously, he's got to be the most talented animal actor since that cat who played Tao in 'The Incredible Journey'. Those various antics of his amounted to a lot more than just a few dumb pet tricks to secure easy \"aww\" reactions from the audience - Eddie had easily as much personality as any of the human ensemble, a subtle and canny little dog who's good at getting what he wants and working his way round the no-nonsense Frasier.As you've probably guessed by now, I loved this show and its cast of characters dearly, and was sorry to see it go in 2004, but at the same time I was pretty much aware that it had run its course. They were starting to rehash older concepts, like Frasier losing Martin's chair, which is always a bad sign. Also, too many OTT British accents from non-British guest actors had a few of us clenching our teeth this side of the Atlantic (Anthony LaPaglia, I'm looking mainly in your direction here!). But I digress, because the general history of this sitcom was just fantastic. Even if the latter-day episodes were a little weaker than the previous instalments, it's the truly great material that, in the end, really stays with you. And throughout the years there was so, so much of it.Mark my words - this show is all set in time to go down as the classic US sitcom of the 90s. 'Friends' may have gotten the greater media coverage when it left its own building in the same year, but 'Frasier' will always be the superior show.Grade: A",

    "top_review": "This show represents the ultimate regret that I failed to tape more shows from the halcyon days when the cartoons were kings.  I taped all of two episodes from that show and blindly placed my trust that the tradition of great cartooning would continue for me to enjoy even as an adult.Now those cartoons are replaced by cable-channel reruns, cheap Japanese imports, or superfluous morning news programs, and I'm left with the slowly fading memories of those shows.But the one show that refuses to be forgotten because of it's uniqueness and charm is the one, the only Dark-weeeeeng Duck!I've heard of superheros who got into the business in order to defend truth, justice and - well, you know the rest.I've heard of superheros who were inspired to do so because of some life-changing trauma they've experienced at the hands of a criminal.But a superhero who gets his kicks because of an ego streak?That's Darkwing Duck for you: the daring, death-defying duck-billed defender of the denizens against the evil forces of darkness, doom and any other grandiloquent alliterations that looks good in a comic book panel. Heck, who needs a comic book when you have a vainglorious vigilante who constantly provides his own narration - even while making breakfast (if he can achieve that in one piece!)This setup makes for perhaps the most satisfying half-hour of superhero-based animation I have ever experienced. Sure, Superman, Batman, the G.I. Joes and other conventional heros in this genre are all good and well, but they are as never as full-rounded as Darkwing Duck. Those other heroes can be so. . .so. . .morally, ethically and methodically impeccable in such a way that it gets boring after a while. Hell, I frequently find myself rooting for the bad guys just so those darn boy scouts will be revealed as, well, HUMAN.Not so with DW. The show successfully lampoons all those other superhero show by having Darkwing encompass pretty much all of the antihero qualities you aren't supposed to occur in a conventional animated superhero. He's obstinant, short sighted, short-tempered, impetuous, arrogant, imperious, clumsy to the point that recalls Inspector Clouseau.  Did I forget to mention the \"ego the size of a small planet\"?  At times, these traits get so in the way of his crimefighting that it becomes difficult to tell the \"hero\" apart from the villain.When you think about it, the idea that superheros can constantly save the day without developing a severe ego streak is ridiculous on its face. So it's should be logical that that should happen in this case, especially when you are dealing with a character who tries deperately to compensate for his lack of actual superpowers.We all know that in the end, even when he seems overwhelmed by his negatives, his positive attributes will eventually win over and help him defeat the villain du jour.  When he's at his best, he really is daring, ingenious, resourceful and kindhearted to boot.Darkwing/Drake Mallard's adopted daughter Gosalyn provides the heart needed for this show, plus she provides a worthy counterpart to DW's more explosive personality.  She is also independent minded, hot-tempered and careless, yet at the bottom very sweet.  Launchpad, besides providing a bridge to that other popular duckbilled show, makes up for his simpleminded ways with his unwavering loyalty to DW.If there's a failing for this show, it would be the fact that since it's a children's show it can get peurile at times (plus it leaves me starving for more violence).   But I won't hold that against them and give it the sterling accolades it deserves.**** out of ****",

    "top_review": "... that day in 1975, when we were watching our favourite TV show, \"M*A*S*H\", \"we\" being big brother -- that's me! -- and little brother. \"M*A*S*H\" had always been our favourite, probably because it seemed so grown-up, but also because it was so irreverent (a word we wouldn't have used back then) and smart-alecky (a word we would have). And so funny. It was tough to say which was the top episode. The one with the wounded Luxembourg soldier? (And the crazy Turk, of course.) One of the ones mentioning our very own Canadian troops? Maybe the one about Capt. Tuttle, graduate of the Berlinisches Polyteschnicum, and the best friend Maj. Frank Burns had ever had? Or possibly any episode even alluding to the wacked-out Col. Flagg?Anyway, this was an important day because Col. Henry Blake had received orders to ship back home to the States. We were feeling pretty sad; we really loved Henry. Hawkeye and Trapper were always putting things over on poor Henry, but Henry always took it with good humour. And probably a little wisdom, and common sense. So Henry had been sent home. The show went to commercial. We were both feeling a little glum. We were sitting quite close to the television; you had to adjust the controls by hand in those days. The show came back from commercial. Radar came into the operating room. \"The plane containing Col. Henry Blake\", if I may paraphrase from memory, \"was shot down over the Sea of Japan. There were no survivors.\" My brother was to my left. We just sat there with our mouths open. Then we ran to tell our parents what had just happened. I can still get a little choked up thinking about it 25 years later. That was the first death I ever experienced in my \"family\"; the show seemed that real to us at the time.",

Now, the way, the show goes on, it shows all these persona's as seen through the eyes-of fresh young dudes. Example-the way-Shaolin fantastic is represented-how they focus on his red pumas--and how the kids talk about him \"His hands are samurai swords\". This is the way, anybody who was there(youngins)-remember that time. Now, some people say It's not gritty (If you want gritty-see Sin HOMBRE), the whole point of rap, was that in was against violence- so, it actuality, this is the memory that will have stayed with the youth, more than the violence-the media loves to OFFICIALLY potray as a BRONX staple. Now, the director is Baz Luhrman, and man, did he potray the music in the most perfect way, the way he could parallelly show some rap group trying to rap, and and the same time a disco pre-queen singining. No, other director could have really showed the music so finely as Baz. If you want nitty -gritty streets-watch the Warriors.

    "top_review": "Interesting way to release this new series - webisodes every couple of weeks that are about 15 minutes long. Put them all together and you potentially have a pilot of just over two hours.For Amanda Tapping, this is a good move - she's not Sam Carter anymore, playing the enigmatic and potentially very sexy Helen Magnus, aided by her slightly stereotypical teen-angst-ed daughter Ashley, some gentle-monster beast and a newly inducted fish out of water type, Will.The concept is nice, 'Sanctuary for all' - being 'all' are non-humans, (but it does come across that they're all sort of imprisoned anyway). There's a sort of 'Gothic Buffy' feel about the scenario and the circumstances, but minus the classic Whedon Buffy humour.The production values aren't superior and it's obviously CGI, there are some sub-par blue/green screens going on in places...but you can forgive this for a decent enough premise and storyline. Knowing that this hasn't been funded by a studio and Tapping herself is an executive producer, one should actually give the production some credit.Tapping is fairly good in this role - we see her move out of the clever and cute Samantha Carter and flex her acting muscles somewhat in the portrayal of an 18th century English woman. Her accent isn't flawless, but you can forgive this - I'm sure it would be explained away that Magnus has been living in the USA for some time. There is no explanation as to why she's in the USA - or if she even is in the USA - the location is not revealed, but one assumes it's in North America.Other actors put in decent enough performances, but there's nothing outstanding. Character wise the weak link here is the character of Ashley. Far too stereotypical, hard and cold. One supposes that she is in some way meant to contrast her mother, but we've seen characters like this far too many times before...she needs some depth.This will be compared to Buffy - the characters aren't immediately associated with the former series - but it's there in the design of the monsters - the characters are also somewhat similar - the blonde fighting machine(Ashley/Buffy), the clever researcher (Magnus/Will/Giles) and monsters that work for the 'good guys'.This 'pilot' doesn't go that far and we need a whole season of this to make a judgement call really. Based on this pilot though, I am intrigued and would like to see more.",

    "top_review": "I didn't watch Felicity when it originally aired because I was sick of all the WB teen dramas like Dawson's Creek, etc. But to compare this to Dawson's Creek and just write it off as another teen drama would be unfair. This series is a heartfelt look at college life and focuses on many issues we all face when we get out into the real world. The thing that makes this series so good is the characters: loveable, easy to identify with. You really care about these people and they are not sleazy soap opera trash characters. These characters are people you would really love to know if they were real and the actors portraying them are not all supermodels, a big plus. Felicity is of course the title character who follows high school crush Ben all the way to a New York college after giving too much thought to something he wrote in her yearbook. Her impulsive decision is a reminder that we are all vulnerable and confused once we leave the home for the first time and get out on our own. We all can identify with her in some way, even if we didn't make a decision that big. The stories are all well done and done so well that you can really see the creators care what they are putting on the screen. All the common themes of teen drama are twisted here. One other outstanding thing is the music and photography. God, that photography! It's beautiful. Felicity was never a ratings winner and was cancelled after only 4 seasons. But don't let that fool you. It didn't get cancelled because it was a bad show. There are many reasons it went to a swift downfall. I think it was being aired on the wrong network (it was the only mature drama on the WB at that time) and the show was too mature for the usual WB viewers and was skipped over by those who were right for it because of the channel it was on. Nevertheless, sometimes good shows get cancelled. If you want a really good series that takes a different approach to college life and the teen drama, check this out. It stands apart from all the other trash shows like Beverly Hills, 90210 and Dawson's Creek. And just to let you know, I am a guy and I love it, so don't think it's a chick show or anything. Buy the DVD set. It's worth it. Especially if you are the same age as the characters.",

I don't think the few people criticizing the show realize just how much talent it takes to make the world laugh, they really don't. However, I'm puzzled only about one thing, \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" but I don't, and it is hovering around #5 in the ratings but The King of Queens, which totally kicks ass on Raymond isn't even showing up in the top 20, what's up with that? Don't get me wrong because I've watched Raymond and I think it is \"okay\" funny but not nearly the caliber that KoQ's is. CBS needs to give a little more respect and focus some PR on the show and especially Kevin James because when movie goers get finally get tired of the very funny Adam Sandler I predict Kevin is next in line (or at least I secretly hope).",

When the first episode ended, everyone was disappointed due to the lack of good jokes. There were moments in the first episode that somehow reminded me of the great mind of Graham Linehan who was the writer to \"Father Ted\" and \"Black Books\" due to random jokes such as the joke in the credits.The second episode was almost redemption to the first as the cast and Graham Linehan ultimately revealed their true performance. It was almost surreal and had it's connections to \"Father Ted\" equally weirdness. There was uncontrollable laughter in a lot of areas of the second episode such as the stress class which delivered powerful comedy that would even make \"Father Ted\" mediocre.I give this comedy a round of applause and wish for an encore.",

It's not a mocumentary and I'm glad for that too - another idea that is going to get old very fast. I laugh constantly throughout each episode.

OK it's not Doctor Who or Battlestar Galatica, Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones but despite the budget, the premise and everything I decided to give the show a shot and I'm so glad I did.This show touched me on many levels. Anyone who feels any sense of entitlement and yet feel lost in a world of so many opportunities will resonate with this show. In fact I think a lot of people can resonate with this show. The show presents and ideology that what we all want, that is people in general just being nicer and warmer to one another. And while this might be a controversial point the fact is since 9/11 American's, especially in the major eastern cities have had a sense of fear instilled in them. Heck from my time in America my opinion was the people were the servants of the Government and not the opposite as it should, and used to, be. This show may well be in its infancy, but they managed to fit a lot into the devue episode and I think they pulled it off very well. I know a lot of people think the premise for the show has been overused in recent times but I think this show is different enough to break away in future episodes and become truly it's own identity. It's not perfect, but it's good and I highly recommend it to anyone.As you can see it's not like some of my favourite shows which I listed at the start (all of which have amazing character and storyline development) but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.For those who enjoy this show you may enjoy the slightly darker movie Short Term 12 which has recently come out (about foster children in a short term care house). I'll finish on that note, which just a quick reminder to not base a show on previous movies but it's own merit. After all a show has opportunities for story and character development which isn't generally available in the Movie time window.Cheers, Cyn",

But, the series knows that it's pathetic, and celebrates that.And, while many episodes are just over the top absurd humor, Filthy Frank sometimes has something he actually has something to say. Now, while it is obvious he doesn't hold some of the opinions he expresses in a few of his videos (I mean, Frank is a character), but, other times, he actually seems to have something to say. For example, his commentary on weeaboos in what seems to be his most popular episode (if you don't count his Harlem Shake video), is actually pretty true and has a good message. Plus, that episode is pretty hilarious. All of Filthy Frank's videos are pretty hilarious! Even if they do get really disgusting and outrageous.In the end, Papa Franku is YouTube at its best.

I get regular laughs from \"Yes, Dear,\" regularly trashed by critics, while I've never laughed a single time at \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" which critics slavishly promote.  YD is about a pair of couples, two sisters and their husbands, who live together in Los Angeles.  The older sister and her husband are lazy, irresponsible slobs who live in the guest house of the younger sister and her husband, who are fastidious to the point of neurosis.  Most of the comedy derives from this dichotomy.  The husbands work for a movie studio (another source of laughs), and both couples have children.  All three sets of grandparents are played by familiar comedic character actors and show up several times each season.

    "critic_rating": "8.7", 
    "top_review": "So here it is at last: one of the most highly anticipated new TV-shows of the year, the spin-off from probably THE most highly praised TV-show in the history of Television. Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.For those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at. Then there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background \"noise\": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.The writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know. And then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments. To sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show.

A lot of people are pointing out, that he is playing hot guy that is not hot. His cheeky smile is adorable, I don't think he is meant to be hot. He is meant to be cute. Ally is adorable and dorky character that reminds me of Zooey Deschanel's character Jess from FOX's New Girl. Very adorkable. Austin and Ally's chemistry is beyond amazing. They remind me of Brennan and Booth on Bones or Castle and Beckett on Castle as teenagers. Trish and Dez are the funny duo, reminding me of Scooby Doo characters. Dez would pull a pretty good Shaggy. I find it much more enjoyable show then was Hannah Montana or Wizards of Waverly Place. Those ones were just boring, comparing to Austin & Ally.",

The two episodes I've seen of Drunk History are some of the most hilarious and entertaining television I've ever seen. The premise is actors/writers/comedians get drunk and tell a story from history, and the scenes described and narrated are acted out. So far, my favorite was where Adam Scott played John Wilkes Booth in the recreation of the Lincoln assassination. Some recognizable names play some of the historical figures; Jack Black was great as Elvis, Dave Grohl as Elivs's lackey, Jonathan Ames, Adam Scott, and Will Forte as Junius, John Wilkes and Edwin Booth, and Fred Willard as 'Deep Throat' in the recreation of the Watergate scandal. The funniest part, to me, is the dialogue the drunken historians give the historical figures that the actors then lip sync. I could use a bit less of the storyteller's vomiting...though, I'm aware that usually goes over well with comedy central's young male demographic. This series has great potential, and I hope it will find the success it deserves.",

Beginning with the dazzling opening credits and stylish musical score, this show is an absolute joy every week. I fail to understand how anyone can possibly be unimpressed by the gorgeous period costumes and sets and the fine, subtle performances of most of the cast. If there's a weakness to be found, it's with Jeremy Piven's acting, though I admit that even he's starting to grow on me as his character begins to acquire a little more dimension. But there's so much else that's wonderful about this series, including engaging story lines, that Piven can almost be overlooked. Overall, it's a light, frothy confection that charms and delights in an easy way that few shows ever manage. But I suppose charm is out of fashion.

But tuning in with a friend from college found us both enjoying the pilot episode a lot more than we had expected.As a member of a Greek society, I can say that a lot of the stereotypes that are brought up here are ones that come up almost every time someone starts talking about the sororities and fraternities on a campus. And are also very fun to play with just on are own, let alone to watch on a TV screen. The opening scene harkened to an only-slightly-dramatized version of preparing for an actual formal rush in some sororities and it continued on from there.This isn't a show for over-sensitive Greeks. If you get offended even at jokes about things that aren't-so-great about Greek life, then you'll spend the entire first episode, and probably many other, cringing and yelling. But everyone else should have a ton of fun watching it. It's nothing new, but when it comes to college, nothing ever is.",

I only caught it because I was watching the hilarious train wreck that is The Secret Life of the American Teenager (god what an awful show).I was expecting more of the same from Bunheads (I have to echo everyone else's sentiments here: that title is terrible). Instead, I found myself totally engrossed. Sutton Foster is an incredible find -- bundles of charisma, great comedic timing and the ability to pull off the dramatic stuff without being cheesy. The conflict between her and Fanny is well pitched and comedic and should carry the show far. The teens are all great actors considering their age and the fact that this is ABC Family, and have a cute camaraderie that will be fertile ground for drama later on (you can see the writers already laying the foundation for this).The best part, though, is the show's humor. Michelle name drops Kirsten Wiig and it's a good comparison -- manic, physical but always with intelligence and heart. The writing obviously never reaches the heights (or the grossness) of Bridesmaids, but Bunheads is honestly funnier than any network comedy not airing on NBC.If you liked Gilmore Girls, or want a family comedy-drama, or are just bored on a Monday night, I highly recommend checking out Bunheads.

    "top_review": "When I first saw this pop up on Amazon Instant Video I was skeptical as I had never watched an Amazon exclusive television series before. And I was well aware of the popularity of rival-Netflix's exclusives and found it hard to believe it would be a worthy competitor.I stand corrected.It took me a single day of blissful binge-watching to finish the entire first season and I must say I am impressed. The characters are strong and able to draw you in, the atmosphere and setting are captivating, and the music is simply top-notch. When all are tied neatly together it makes for a wondrously entertaining season. And how could one forget: the comedy! Whilst of course it is entirely subjective, I found every episode to be wholesomely amusing. Every character is entertaining in their own right and not a single line seems unfit for purpose. The humour was exactly to my liking and did not fall into the trap so many comedies today do in which they attempt to be hilarious and unfortunately end up just being silly.As expected, however, it is not perfect. One particular instance in which I found myself to eventually drift-off was the Rodrigo-Anna Maria sub-plot. I did not find this to be interesting, rather I thought it tiresome. Despite both characters being excellently written and the acting being spot-on, this didn't quite engross me like the rest of the show did.In addition, a criticism I have (perhaps a minor one) pertains to the memorability of the characters. Specifically: their names! Maybe it was just me but halfway through the season I still only knew a couple of the characters' names. This could be in part to blame on my binge-watching manner, or, more worryingly, the writing. Regardless, I consider these to be minor blemishes upon the finished product.Let us end on a high note: the music. The music is what makes this so fresh. If it weren't for the music, I do believe this would just be another average comedy. The music adds something more, a passion, as Rodrigo may say. It truly does draw you in and you really can feel the energy and enthusiasm. It's what makes this show stand out from the rest and what kept me enthralled, among other things. I am absolutely delighted with the first season of Mozart in the Jungle and will be returning for season two.",

And other are unfairly comparing this one to \"Fringe\", which I LOVE BTW.But Warehouse 13 occupies a lighter plane. Pete & Myka are NOT Mulder & Scully, and I do NOT want a repeat of that dark, tortuous, and frankly 'too-full-of-themselves' conspiracy skulduggery.There's NO Dark conspiracy here-- just a mysterious organization that's trying to keep all the strange and powerful 'Objects' in a safe place where they can do no harm. The Fun is watching the two agents bounce off each other as they try and figure out the puzzle of WHAT the 'Object' is and how to Counter-act it. Sometimes, the hunt is serious-- but never Dark and bloody. Other times, the hunt is light and comical. And the episodes waver back and forth, giving the viewer a range of emotional impact-- but never too deep or too hilarious. It keeps a side of Serious without going too heavy for too long-- and yes-- they always pull through at the end-- and hello folks, that what most of Network TV shows are about. Because that's what most People really want when they turn on their TV after a Long hard day at work. Don't knock it.And unlike a lot of current Sci-Fi shows (And here I also include Fringe) Warehouse is all about the fact that 'Mysteries' and 'Mythical Objects of Power' exist; but there is NO attempt to studiously explain the WHY or HOW. They just exist, and they can cause wonder, havoc, terror and joy-- but they all tend to have a Price.And the Warehouse Organization is itself a seeming Mystery in and of itself. It seems to be OLDER than the US Gov't for one. And its Principals-- like Mrs. Fredrick seem to be 'Unexplainables' themselves.For me-- Mrs. Fredricks is a gem of a character. She exudes gravitas. She's Utterly Unflappable and fundamentally dowdy like a Cast-Iron Grandma. Just don't be so foolish as to expect her to kiss you goodnight before you go to bed. Like Pete says: \"She could just Glare you to death.\"And she NEVER seems to WALK anywhere. She and her Bodyguard just APPEAR. But the DOOR never moves. That's a Nice touch.Besides, Warehouse could be classified as an entertaining Family Show. Fringe is NOT for Kids. And X-Files is in a class by itself.Take this show at it's own worth.",

In the prophecy it is foretold that Emma would be the one to return and save them from the dreaded curse.Now while there are many other characters in the story it is meant to revolve around Emma and the issues she must face in order to overcome the curse. The story shows much promise already and with no doubt it is sure to progress as the show continues. Morrison (Emma), Goodwin (Snow White), and Parrilla (Evil Queen) have already hit all of the right notes in just the first episode, Parrilla I loved mainly because she makes a very worthy villain in the show.Even though it has only begun there is great room for success and progress. I think this could be the show of the fall/winter TV season to watch. If any one decides to watch just one show this fall then let it be Once Upon a Time.",

Lauren Faust has taken her unique character design style and warm-hearted characterizations and breathed new life into My Little Pony. The result is a new spin on the franchise that's super cute but not saccharine with just enough added snark and outrageous humor.But it should not be looked at as another My Little Pony cartoon. Instead, it should be looked at as a good show that just happens to have characters from the franchise. But instead of being girly or cheesy, the show has winning humor and wonderful characters. The kingdom feels like it has real places with real neighborhoods. The families have brothers and sisters and older ponies. Magic returns to the ponies and feels real instead of tacked on. There are not too many villains in this show but there are a couple monsters. However the real conflict and drive of the show, and what makes it so interesting, is in seeing how different and varied the personalities of the characters are and how they often act like real friends, complete with disagreements. This is the most educational version of My Little Pony yet. However, unlike preschool cartoons, the lessons don't feel forced or pandering.This is one of the most remarkable cartoons yet.

His comedy is somehow both universal yet specific, appealing to a worldwide audience yet never losing touch of his English heritage. But enough about that, this is about something more important.... Derek....The Office was a brilliantly clever comedy, Extras was even better, Life's Too Short was criminally underrated and wasn't given a chance to find it's feet, An Idiot Abroad is a masterful use of a genuinely interesting and captivating idiot and then there's Derek....Derek is a masterpiece. I have to qualms about stating that. In future years, maybe even five or ten years down the track, Derek will be the sitcom that all other sitcoms are compared to. The sitcom formula of a studio audience and general dumb jokes is already all but dead, and Derek is the nail in the coffin of such shows. In fact, it is the inevitable fresh step forward for sitcoms in general.Derek lets go of the usual sitcom laughs and replaces them with real life giggles. Sometimes you're not even sure why you're smiling, then you realise it's because of the situation you're watching. Even worse, sometimes you don't even realise you're smiling.But it's the emotion of Derek that sets it apart from other sitcoms. It's not lame, superficial, meaningless emotion either, it's real emotion, due in no small part to the brilliant supporting cast. In almost every episode I've watched so far I've gotten teary. And thats exactly where the future is for sitcoms. Real emotion. People are getting sick of cheap laughs and emotionless humor. The best comedy comes from tragedy, always has and always will. It's a shame it's taken TV 60 years to realise that. Derek, along with a select few other shows, may very well be the savior of the sitcom. Because if I the future of sitcoms is Two And A Half Men then I might as well kill myself now.",

Styled in mockumentary fashion, Derek (Ricky Gervais) is the story of a man who works in a British nursing home, helping to care for its residents. While Derek could be said to suffer somewhat, lacking in some mental faculty, this remains debatable throughout. The story takes place primarily within the nursing home, yet does venture beyond those walls into the world of the norm. The character subjects vary from typically aged to otherwise different-from-norm. Derek's primary colleague is Hannah (Kerry Godliman), who has apparently worked in the home for some time and exhibits great care toward her subjects.",

    "top_review": "Normally I don't critique sitcoms because, frankly, it's not worth the effort and are so crassly superficial that they don't require any serious attention. But in the case of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" I will make an exception. This is because of one character: Jed Clampett, played by Buddy Ebsen. Jed Clampett is one of the most endearing yet complex characters ever created by the television industry. Superficially, Jed Clamptett doesn't seem to be the type of character that warrants much serious attention. After all he's just a simple, uneducated backwoodsman from the hills who's lived in a shack all of his life, and by pure dumb luck comes into a pile of money which doesn't seem to change him one bit. Which is what makes Jed Clampett such a wonderful character. For Jed Clampett has dignity and integrity and nothing will divert Mr. Clampett from remaining true to himself or altering the way he treats everyone - with openness, honesty and a real desire to be hospitable. Further, Jed Clampett commands respect, and is respected, not only by his immediate family who are utterly devoted to him, but even by that crass and conniving banker who, despite his air of superiority, reveals, episode after episode, what a buffoon he is compared to the calm and self-assured Mr. Clampett. Also, it should be noted the Jed Clampett protects and cares for not only his daughter, but his nephew and mother-in-law, the latter two a constant challenge to Jed's patience, which he never loses. If there were more Jed Clampetts in this world, then maybe we'd all be living in shacks, but at least we'd be getting along with each other and treating each other better.",

    "top_review": "I remember the days when I couldn't wait for Friday, I was just 2 years old when Full House began, but I remember for some odd reason just watching this show from day one. Full House has always brought back great memories for me, it's the one show I absolutely loved as a child and couldn't miss. I think because I always wanted to be apart of the Tanner family, they always seemed to have it together, have fun, and could solve any problem within half an hour, lol. Now, I still watch the show, I admit, it's an ultimate guilty pleasure. But I think I have a different out look on the show now.At the time when 80's comedy shows came, it seemed like the popular thing was the single dad bit. Danny Tanner is a widowed father who has three young beautiful daughters: DJ(Donna Joe), Stephanie, and Michelle. His rock and roll brother in law, Jesse, comes to help him out having to abandon his living on the edge life style to take care of his little nieces. And Joey, Danny's life long best friend also moves in, a struggling comedian who brings a little humor and kindness to the family. Together they all go through life and it's little problems, but shows the bright side to each one.The positives about this show is that it always had good morals, in some sick way, I think this helped me stay as a clean cut kid. It had typical problems that a lot of people knew how to relate too, including for kids growing up. The humor was also a plus, yeah, it's a bit cheesy at times compared to today's sitcoms, but it's still in all good fun like Leave It To Beaver style. Also many people could easily love most of the characters on the show or could relate to them. I always loved Stephanie personally, she always made me laugh and just seemed like the person I'd like to be friends with.The negatives, problems were solved a little too well, where it could make you believe life was that easy, or at least you would wish it to be so. Then some of the characters got a little annoying, like Michelle, she went from a cute little baby to a spoiled brat, and the show became more about her in the later seasons, which I didn't appreciate. Then the twins that Jesse and Rebecca had were again little brats that were more annoying than cute.But this show is a huge hit with our pop culture, it still plays on TV today. It also had major career boosts for John Stamos and of course, the Olsen twins. This is a very fun show that will always bring back awesome memories for me. I still watch it, I honestly have driven my mother insane with Full House, I probably will drive my children insane with it as well, but I can't help it, this is a fun show that I think is an honest classic. It always makes you feel good about yourself and about life, as cheesy as that sounds, you'll like it, I'm sure.",

    "top_review": "This has become my favorite show on television. It has its own special charm to it. I love the characters in the Darling family. The acting is superb for nearly all of them. Donald Sutherland is incredible as always in the role of Tripp, the tactful businessman. Then you have Glenn Fitzgerald as Brian, the flawed priest; William Baldwin as Patrick, the spineless politician; Samaire Armstrong as Juliet, the spoiled daughter; Seth Gabel as Jeremy, the reluctant playboy; Natalie Zea as Karen, the impetuous harlot; and Jill Clayburgh as Letitia, the spaced-out mother.The character of Brian is the one I find the most entertaining. He perfectly pulls off being a complete jerk, which makes his contrasting moments of humanity that much more impressive. His relationship with his son brought some of the funniest and most heartfelt moments of the season, which is really saying something considering the strength of the rest of the show. The character of Jeremy is intriguing as well, as he's somewhat of a security blanket for Juliet. Fitzgerald and Gabel show off their acting talents in these roles, but it's Sutherland that steals the show.The well-acted characters don't stop there, though. Peter Krause nails the role of Nick, the lawyer/babysitter for the family. Will Shadley is adorable as Brian Jr. Blair Underwood adds mystery as the rival billionaire. Daniel Cosgrove gave a memorable performance as Karen's boytoy Freddy. Shawn Michael Patrick adds even more talent as the obedient limo driver. Zoe McLellan is stuck in that middle as Nick's wife Lisa, along with fascinated-by-rich-life daughter Kiki, portrayed by Chloe Moretz.There are precious few flaws with this show. Leticia, Patrick, Juliet, and Karen can grow tiresome, partly because their characters are sometimes intended to annoy the viewers with their actions. However, the truth is that Clayburgh, Baldwin, Armstrong, and Zea simply don't possess the acting talent of the rest of the cast. I can hate and love Brian at the same time, and I can't say that for the rest of these characters who are supposed to elicit similar feelings.The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is because the latest episodes haven't been quite as good as the early ones. Still, I think that speaks more to the excellence of the show's beginning more than anything else. There's plenty of potential to develop all the characters much further, as you could make a lesser series based on any one of the characters. I don't know what the future holds for this show, but I can only hope that we haven't seen the last of it. If they give this enough of a chance, I think it will be truly great.I worry, though, because nearly everyone I try to talk to about it hasn't heard of it, and we're going on a few weeks now without a new episode. It seems pretty high-budget as well. I think a little more promotion or patience could save the show. I fear the worst, but I'll breathe a sigh of relief if I see another new episode in the new year.Please, ABC, keep this show going. If it disappears, it will be sorely missed.",

    "top_review": "Opening with a healthy battle at sea makes a good start to any film about pirates, and 'Crossbones' plays it safe by delivering just that; ship cannons are fired, people get shot up close by muskets, throats get slit and heads get bashed in: welcome to the new NBC-show about one of the most famous \u0096 and notorious \u0096 pirates ever: Blackbeard.Enter John Malkovich, the show's star, who delivers yet another great turn playing the outlaw legend. His portrayal of the character is rather original; instead of giving us a stereotypical, larger-than-life performance with a Keith Richards look, we get a coldly calculating older man, well spoken and with a nicely tamed - grey - beard.Malkovich's portrayal might not even be so far off: according to Wikipedia, Blackbeard was not a tyrannical pirate and he commanded his vessels only with their crews' permission; apparently there is also no known account of him murdering prisoners and he preferred using his cleverly constructed fearsome image to induce terror over committing actual acts of violence.But that is (probably) as far as historical accuracy will go in 'Crossbones', for this certainly isn't a history lesson (not that I complain), but solid entertainment with a historical background. So far, I'm satisfied with what I've seen. The cast \u0096 especially Richard Coyle, who plays the show's protagonist Tom Lowe \u0096 is very good, the plot evolves nicely and the set design looks real; fake looking CGI is \u0096 so far \u0096 mercifully absent. Judging from the first episode, my verdict is a solid (if not overly excited): \"Yar!\" \u0096 7 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

It was simultaneously the best new show, the best western series in decades, and the best sci-fi show on TV (and coming from a die-hard Trekkie, placing them above \"Enterprise\" is saying something).  They didn't have a single bad episode, and some were spectacular.  The premise, the characters, the plots and the dialogue were all top-notch.  And FOX cancelled it without even really giving it a chance.Maybe the show couldn't stand in the end.  Maybe I'm alone in this, and there aren't enough fans to justify what the show cost.  But making that call after half a season, with half of the episodes pre-empted for baseball playoffs was a phenomenally stupid thing to do.  That show should have been here to stay, and it got axed without a chance to prove itself.  I only pray the movie works out.  At least we'll have something.",

And there's also a great deal of understandable awkwardness that seems as pertinent to 2013 to the '50s. It's an absorbing, beautifully acted story about science, emerging feminism and American culture. But it's also a gamble on the idea that great TV drama can involve stakes that are not sharpened to pointy tips. It was comforting to see that Masters of Sex has depth of vision and plenty of dramatic material to delve into without taking the easy way out with a nipple and a romp every 10 minutes :)",

His inability to do two things at once when it comes to acting (for example deliver a line and hang up a phone) is hilarious to watch. Some of the highlights include a \"dirt bike\" chase through a forest (using tiny children's bicycles), a doctor being attacked by a steam iron and another being chased by a possessed stapler, a woman turning into broccoli and Dean Learner trying to justify how he punched a child actor. However, you have to see it to realize how funny it really is, my words can't do enough. Darkplace won't appeal to everyone's tastes, but still it looks like it will probably be a cult hit. If its ever repeated, its worth a look just to see what you think. It provides a refreshing change from awful reality TV and soap operas.I, for one, can't wait for the DVD and/or a second batch of episodes \"from the Channel 4 vaults\". I give it a solid 10/10.",

I had it for a week without touching it, then I decided to pop it in and watch the first episode, I was thrilled! When I first heard that the WB was doing a teen drama about the young life of Clark Kent, I thought \"Hell No!!\" they wouldn't dare take a legend like Superman and cross it with Dawson's Creek! How wrong I was. This show is intelligent, moving, intriguing and just plain fun to watch! I am also in the fortunate position to have only experienced the show on DVD on my 96\" front projection system, so the show has taken on a cinematic element for me that most people won't get. Because of this, I do not watch the show on television at all, it's strictly a DVD event for me. This of course means that I cannot catch up with the show as it run's on the WB, but i'm committed to watching it only on DVD. For wide-screen purists like myself, the show being open matted from 1.78:1 is the only deterrent I need to abstain from the WB runs of the show.Sadly, Tom Welling will not be Superman in the up-coming film, that's a real shame, he embodies that character so much. The episode entitled 'Rosetta' with the late Christopher Reeve is perhaps one of the most riveting hours i've witnessed on television since 'The Body' episode of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. Clark's struggle against the wishes of his birth father Jor-El are very mysterious and somewhat disturbing to watch.Micheal Rosenbaum as Lex Luther brings so many multi-dimensional elements to this iconic (eventual) villain that he even manages to make Gene Hackman's Lex seem downright flat and cardboard-ish. We all know that he will become Superman's arch-enemy, but how and why? This show dares to explore those questions with surprising freshness and intrigue. Though I suspect that he will be Superman's enemy, not Clark's. They have a brotherly bond that I would hate to see broken, but have prepared myself for that.John Shneider and Annette O'Toole as Clark's Earth-bound parents are so warm and caring that it creates a strong emotional foundation for the show. The Kent farm is ground zero for the show and for Clark's eventual life as Superman. All of his values begin their, the man of steel we all come to know was forged with the guidance of two simple farm folk in Kansas. This show captures that so richly that it makes the short 10 minute sequence in Richard Donner's film seem woefully insufficient.Yes, the weakest character is Lana, but it's not the fault of Kristin Kreuk (she's so hot, I could stare into those gorgeous eyes of hers all day), it's in our knowledge that she WILL be cast aside, we know this to be true, we have seen Clark's future and Lana has no place in it. So all of their scene's together have an undercurrent of futility about them. Although to Clark and Lana, at those moment's, they don't know what tomorrow brings for them, so I can tolerate them pursuing their relationship.I read one very distressful thing in one of the user comments, it said that Tom Welling only agreed to play Clark Kent, not Superman. We NEED to see him become Superman on or about the last episode of the series, it is CRUCIAL! That, after all, is the payoff, to see him in the suit and ready to tackle the world and embrace the destiny we have all seen him struggle to realize and reach. Without that moment, the series will seem anti-climatic with no payoff.I give this show 10 out of 10 stars. If your a Superman fan, you must see this show!",

It would be a GREAT show to enjoy as a family and in that enjoyment I could get past some of the overly clich\u00e9d acting, directing, and dialogue. However, some of the language, some of the violence, and the current time slot seem to indicate that the producers aren't interested in a preteen audience... and the silliness, plot holes, and overall feel presented in the Pilot lead me to believe they won't be able to develop a loyal audience of mature viewers. I can't imagine The Cape lasting much beyond an initial order of episodes. For all of the potential the show has, it misses on too many levels and fails to properly reach any defined audience.",

I do not see the appeal to any of them anymore and I do not often watch the programming block anymore. Venture Bros. However stands apart from the rest and provides truly intelligent, well thought out, over-the-top and hilarious entertainment. The show is a perfect balance between tasteless humor and really clever subtleties. The homage/lambasting of early adventure animation/comics is spot on. The characters are full of depth and they're engaging. Brock Samson could pwn Chuck Norris any day of the week. What more could one want?When I first saw this show I thought it was one of the more ******* up shows I'd ever seen. I was surprised just how graphic it was with particularly disturbing images(guy getting his eyes gouged out, watching a henchman struggle with his last breaths as he's strangled to death by Brock, poll vaulting off henchman's jugular...etc.) I was not turned off though because aside from the surprising imagery, the jokes and references were all spot-on. I was laughing the whole way through and intrigued around every corner. Truly, my only real gripe with the show is that it has a hard time taking itself seriously and often resorts to fairly flippant endings and/or resolutions that sometimes I feel aren't necessary. I think the show could support itself just fine with a persistent story arc, which I think we are starting to see more of in the new season anyway, so that's good.And again, Brock Samson, there could hardly be a better cartoon character.Check out this show, it's well worth it. I hope that it continues for a long time.",

These people did Halo, and placed it in Gulch, a multi-player map in Halo. They recorded all this stuff and stuck it together into these short web shorts that would eventually make a season, which is more like a feature length movie, about and hour 1/2.I have dial-up so it took forever to get the first few videos and for me it wasn't worth it. So whenever it came out as a movie on DVD at gamestop, I had to go get it! I was blessed ten fold from what I expected! It is hilarious! Most of the jokes are really funny and some try to be funny, fail, and are still funny! It does have many Insiders so I might advise watching the commentary after you've watched the original movie.Everything has character and personality. Its not what you would expect a Halo movie to be about. It does have a little combat but just a little. Its all about the funny in this movie. Itis about these two groups of Spartans, one is Red and the other Blue (hence the name) and somehow they are in this civil war in the middle of a canyon fighting for flags. OK the fighting for flags is awesome for multi player games, but not for a story line. The awesome thing is they admit it! When asked why they needed the flag and why it was important they didn't have an answer! They just stuttered and said something like its the flag! We've gotta have it! So if you are out looking for a gift for the Halo fanatic in your family or just anyone ready for a good laugh, pick this one up. Caution, it cusses...a lot...but its still funny :D",

So what does CBS do? Say that a show about ghosts would \"skew younger\" than one about talking to God. Shame, shame, on you CBS. You promised that the show would be moved to another time slot before you canceled it, and you canceled it after making Barbara Hall introduce a new character that would hopefully bring in more viewers, while leaving the exit point for the show all the more sloppy and unresolved.Some other network needs to pick this show up now. It's been nominated for an Emmy, which it also might be again this year, and won the People's Choice Awards. It's got an estimated eight million viewers, which is pretty good considering it was up against Dateline and in a time slot when people are out and about (early evenings on Fridays, also not a time when a lot of the teenagers are home, so that also explains why the average age of the viewers was so high). It's really sad that a show which makes you think, feel, cry and laugh at the same time can be thrown away so easily, while all the reality TV junk and crime dramas that are all-too-similar are thriving. This show was the finest ever to grace TV, and I highly recommend it to anyone that is sick of the few choices left to watch on television anymore.",

    "top_review": "I was happy to see Aziz Ansari's new comedy series Master of None was recently released on Netflix. Being a fan of jamming as much of a new show into my life as I can, I immediately tore into the ten episode season. After trying to feel the show out in the first episode, I easily slipped into the next few, catching myself laughing while also being engaged with the show's unique perspectives. I've been a fan of Aziz for a long time, especially his stand-up and Parks and Recreation. Utilizing his stand-up platform, Aziz has been cultivating and relaying his thoughts and observations of life from the vantage point of the son of Indian immigrants who chose to raise a family in the southern United States. That's not his only vantage point however, as he also sees himself rightfully as any other young American, submersed in today's culture. Something he doesn't take for granted, utilizing it instead of shying away from it, with the results often being amazing, heartfelt comedy. All of which has an incredibly genuine feeling to it, as if Aziz never fully gave up ties to his childhood, instead continuing to let that side of him flourish.A pop-culture glutton, Aziz often quips about how easily a text message can change the course of your day, how dating and relationships make absolutely no sense, and how we should treat each other better. Master of None is the evolution of these observations, originally perfected on stage, and now presented to us applied to real life situations. The best part about this evolution is the fact that he's not afraid to criticize them, and the show highlights this by offering up multiple view points from a diverse set of characters, often his friends.Master of None hints at something great, at times still unsure of itself in the best way possible. Continuing to shift perspectives until a universal truth is uncovered connecting us all to the insanity that is our lives in our modern age. Technology, dating, racism, sexuality, consumerism, parenting, and marriage are all examined in less than four episodes, although no real conclusions are made. The show not focusing on lessons, but rather understanding and perspective.If you're a fan of Louie, I have absolutely no doubt that you'll be interested to give Master of None a real shot. There's something here for almost everyone, if you don't think so, you may be just another voice this project is trying to showcase, all of us.Personally, the only thing I thought the show was missing was Kanye West.",

This makes the show very much like Alan Partridge- wry and funny in its painfulness.The only sympathetic characters in the show are the dwarfs that are in Warwick Davis' (halfhearted) care, yet they are juxtaposed with carnival-esque clownery slapstick as we don't see on television as it is politically incorrect.

I have watched so many box kits of Sopranos, Dexter, In Treatment, Mad Men etc.. yet this series tops them all. I am overwhelmed by the quality and as someone who works in theatre and film i can highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to see how it is done best!The way the series covers both the police investigation and the victim's family's turmoil is unique in crime dramas, the nature of grief and its effects on families, the emerging information in its many guises, ie things the family discover that were kept secret, and the slow and intelligent police case, coupled with subtle insights into all of the relationships. A show that never falls into clich\u00e9 or stereotypes, and is shot with such beautiful lighting and moodiness that it is visually arresting.

    "top_review": "This series has all the qualities that should go into a horrid sitcom. The acting is beneath sub-par--with kids who were clearly picked more for their \"look\" than their acting abilities. The writing is so syrupy and pedestrian as to make \"Martha Stewart's Living\" look edgy and sophisticated by comparison. And the production quality looks like that of a 5th-rate syndicated show from 1987.And, yet there is something oddly mesmerizing about this show. Maybe it's Aaron Spelling's knack for populating a world with such pretty people with such simple, easily solved problems. Maybe it's part of a secret desire to live in such an uncomplicated world where good guys are soapy pure and every house has a picket fence. Or maybe I just like to ogle Jessica Biel.But what I really think is so appealing about this show is its camp value. Like a really cheesy B-horror film, 7th Heaven is at its best when it's at it worst. The hokier the story-line, the worse the acting; the more you have to laugh at it. It's like a train-wreck that you HAVE to watch--to find out who will introduce the next groan-inducing plot point, who will utter the next over-rehearsed bit of \"spontaneous\" dialogue, or what guest star has sunk so low this week.7th Heaven is must-see TV, if for nothing else than watching desperate sup-par directors' constant cutaways to the family dog (to cover bad edits and, presumably, even worse dialogue). And the great thing is, the dog is actually a better actor than most of the kids on the show.So, check it out. Get some popcorn, and have a good laugh.",

This very edgy drama and esp. Leary's character shows the dark side, and his 'secret evil plan' instead of whitewashing every guy as a hero, as competent or even, sober. I love that the moral center keeps shifting underneath their feet, just as in real life. There's a million stories in the Naked City, and \"Rescue Me\" could tell them all.I've been waiting for a show like this to come along because I practically grew up in a firehouse, and I know so did a million other kids in America.

    "critic_rating": "7.7", 
    "top_review": "My first exposure to Arnold was long before the show's key audience was born, let alone heard of him. It was in a small clay-mation film \"Arnold Escapes from Church,\" which was one of many at the 21st Tournee of Animation in at the Huntington Arts Cinema on Long Island. The football-headed kid that we all know and love sits in church with his family while the pastor reads \"The Lord's Prayer,\" and imagines all kinds of weird things happening in the process. At a time when anti-media zealots were frantically trying to censor anything they assume will warp children's collective imaginations, so much so that they virtually eliminate their imaginations, this was one of a few 'toons(other than perhaps MUPPET BABIES) that made it seem acceptable. By the early-to-mid 1990's though, such a mentality seemed all too common-place, and the Arnold Universe was less focused on the world in his head than the world around him.Arnold is street-wise, rational, and good-natured to a fault. He lives in a boarding house owned by his grandparents, which CLAIMS that kids aren't allowed, but makes an exception for him and one other. He's got perhaps the coolest bedroom any kid could possibly have. Not even three-dimensional FedEx from the remake of \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" has a room as cool as Arnold's, even though that was a cool bedroom as well. Arnold's rural neighborhood is surrounded by eccentric kids and adults. And who are the people in his neighborhood, to paraphrase the late Fred Rogers? Well, the kids consist of Gerald, Helga, Stinky, Eugene, Lila, Rhonda, Harold, Sid, Phoebe, and others. The adults consist of his grandparents(Phil and Pookie), Mr, Hyunh, Oskar, his wife Susie, Ernie Potts, and a host of other eccentrics. One can not say anything about \"Hey Arnold!\" without focusing on Helga Pataki, who has the kind of relationship with him you might expect from nine-year-old girls and boys. Helga, of course publicly insults and torments him, but privately agonizes over her desire for him, and frequently beats herself up over how she treats him. And who can blame her for her guilt? He's the kind of kid who knows you don't have to be a superhero to do good. In \"Stoop Kid,\" he teaches a bullying brat not to be afraid to leave the stoop of his apartment. In \"Pigeon Man,\" he befriends a neighborhood recluse who's treated like a freaky urban legend, because he'd rather spend time with homing pigeons. In \"Runaway Float\" he stops the title from crashing into City Hall, and taking his friends with it. In \"Grandpa's Sister,\" he mends a long standing grudge that began over the death of a beloved family pet. In \"Crabby Author,\" he visits a favorite children's author who's now a reclusive, bitter old woman, and inspires her to return to the career that made her famous. He even makes an impact on Helga Pataki, sometimes intentionally.One thing's for sure, Craig Bartlett really knows how to celebrate the holidays, whatever those holiday may be. In the unforgettable \"Arnold's Christmas,\" Arnold struggles to reunite Mr. Hyunh with his South Vietnamese daughter who he hasn't seen since the Fall of Saigon. In \"Arnold's Halloween,\" we see Arnold and Gerald repeat their own adaptation of Orson Welles' \"War of the Worlds,\" only in their case they WANT to cause a panic! In \"Veteran's Day,\" we find how Arnold's Grandfather contributed to the allied victory in the Battle of the Bulge by giving the Nazis bad experimental lunch-meat, and Gerald's Dad was a reluctant Vietnam Vet who was assigned to desk duty and saved the life of a wounded G.I. with his paperwork(literally!) after a major NVA attack.In truth, Bartlett does not write children's television. He writes adult television with kids as his central characters, that are not excessively violent or sexually suggestive. An outstanding 'toon if there ever was one on Nickelodeon, which will be difficult to replace.",

    "top_review": "Dracula living in a trailer park instead of a castle. NOSFERATU out on the bayou. THE LOST BOYS hangin' out down by the Chattahoochie with a keg, instead of in an underground lair with a beachfront view. A great dinner of catfish, blackeyed peas and rice and cornbread, served up with a tall, warm, bubbly bottle of...BLOOD.However you want to describe it, TRUE BLOOD is not only unlike any vampire story that's been done before, it's not like any series that's on right now. It's DARK SHADOWS-meets deep-fried Southern Gothic, and only Alan Ball, the creator of SIX FEET UNDER, would dare stick his neck out to bring it to you.Based on the novels of Charlaine Harris, which I've never read, (but certainly will after this!), BLOOD takes place in the not-too-distant future. It's been two years since the world got a shock it never expected: vampires came \"out of the coffin\" as a race. We suspected they always lived - and fed - amongst us, but now it's official, and just as before with race relations and as it is now with GLBT people, the reaction across the board is the same - fear of change and fear of the unknown influences most people's feelings about it. And it doesn't seem to matter much that vamps now opt for finding nourishment from a bottled beverage made of synthetic plasma called - wait for it - \"TRU BLOOD\", rather than from the warm, breathing, two-legged receptacles called Everybody Else.Sookie Stackhouse, however, has her own unique take on the whole deal. Sookie (X-MEN'S Anna Paquin) lives and works as a waitress in Bon Temps, LA, at a roadhouse restaurant called Merlotte's, the center of most of the series' action. She serves up pitchers of beer and sweet tea, and will give you a piece of her mind, once she has a piece of yours...though you'll wonder how she knew what you were thinking. Sookie is a telepath, and unfortunately for her, she can't turn off the constant flow of other peoples' streams of consciousness...most of which offers way too much information.The only minds she can't read are vampire minds, something she discovers when she encounters Bon Temps' first vamp, the courtly and smoldering Bill Compton (Brit actor Stephen Moyer in a bravura performance). They are taken with each other on first sight - Sookie, who is not afraid of the unusual since she herself fits that category all too well, and Bill because he cannot figure her out - is she mortal, or something more?Looking on this blossoming romance in various stages of curiosity, disgust or outright disapproval are Sookie's brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten), a walking hormone on two legs whose IQ matches his boot size; headstrong, opinionated Tara (Rutina Wesley), Sookie's childhood BFF; Sam Merlotte himself (Sam Trammell), Sookie's boss, who's got it bad for her and wears his heart on his sleeve on and off the clock; Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis), the boldly out, proud and randy cook who serves as Greek chorus, instigator and confidante to Merlotte's employees, but most especially to Sookie, and her 'Gran', Adele Stackhouse (the marvelous Lois Smith), who couldn't be happier that Sookie is romantically involved with somebody...even if he is undead. Not a single opportunity is wasted here to explore every nuance of mixing the ordinary with the extraordinary, in a way that even a series as outstanding as BUFFY could only get close to. Passion burns, secrets abound, betrayal, murder and things even worse lurk around every corner. It's what you've hoped for but never gotten from every soap opera that couldn't show you what was REALLY going on...until now.Best of all, TRUE BLOOD is like the best songs that come from Mississippi Delta blues. It has an irresistible melody and a driving beat that pulses with sex, muscular sensuality and undeniable heat, with an undertone of menace lurking just beneath, ready to explode without warning...and sometimes even without provocation.As with 6FU, Ball and his crew are firing on all cylinders here in the first two episodes I've seen. I sure hope they can keep it going...With the early renewal for a second season, HBO sure seems to agree, and so do the fans. Especially this one.",

    "top_review": "I love this hilarious sitcom and catch it on re runs whenever I chance upon it. I think it is one of the funniest family comedy series ever, with some entertaining and unusual character portrayals.The series revolves around the Keaton family, with liberal parents Steven (a TV station manager) and Elyse (an architect). The couple have three children...a financially savvy, politically conservative son Alex, his shopaholic teenage sister Mallory, and a younger tomboy sister, Jennifer. Later Elyse gives birth to a fourth child, baby Andrew. Along the way, Alex develops love interests, first in the form of Ellen (played by the actor's future wife, Tracy Pollan) and later, Lauren, a psychology major. Mallory acquires a boyfriend herself, the motorcycle riding high school drop out, Nick, who incurs the disapproval of her parents and of course especially brother Alex.The acting is stellar with Meredith Baxter and Michael Gross portraying the parents and Tina Yothers the kid sister, Jennifer. However, it is really Michael J. Fox's show with his hilarious depiction of Alex P. Keaton, who has a tendency to wear shirt & tie everyday around the house and introduces little brother Andrew to the Wall Street Journal while he's still in diapers! My personal favourite is Mallory (charmingly played by Justine Bateman); she is so amusing and endearing as his dim witted, academically slack, clothes obsessed sister who cannot get enough of the mall and talking about cute boys. Of course her contrast with the smart, serious, & focused Alex could hardly be greater.It's a reverse generational tale to the expected. Normally the parents are the conservative ones, with the teenage offspring liberal rebels and rabble rousers. However, the Keaton parents are the left wing family members, former political activists back in their college heyday. Son Alex, on the other hand, is a die-hard and very vocal card carrying Republican who eventually finds his niche on Wall Street. The sparring between Alex and his parents (as well as with Mallory) makes for some wonderful comedy in this warm hearted family sitcom.",

Their only normal kid is young Jennifer, a bit of a tomboy. In later seasons, the Keatons add a fourth child, Andrew. Most of the comedy arose from the conflict between the liberal parents and the conservative children.",

    "top_review": "Enterprise is the most genuinely invigorating thing to happen to not only Trek, but television as well.  But I don't really want to rehash everything that everybody else has said, want I want to do is express my disappointment in a majority of the fans. Back Off!!!  A lot of the comments on this site have been nothing more than whining and nit-picking about what Enterprise \"isn't.\"  The concept of this show has apparently flown past your heads at warp 4.5!  This isn't Trek as we know it!  That is the point, the traditional Trek was a tired dog that was on it's last leg.  The idea here is to do something new, something different that we weren't ready for.  Stop analyzing what it should be, what it could be, and what it has already done wrong. For those of you who haven't yet seen it, I'm telling you that it is fantastic; it's thrilling, touching, funny, adventurous, and as interesting and curious as the original series.  But, when you watch it, go in with ABSOLUTELY no preconceived notions of what Trek is or what it should be. Berman and Braga have done exactly what they have set out to do and that is to reinvent Trek. And for those of you who apparently had to bite your lip through this, where the heck is YOUR sense of adventure.  We are seeing the BEGINNING of Star Trek! This is a dream come true!  I mean come on guys,  we got to witness the FIRST time they ever see a Klingon!! How cool is that.  If you would stop trying, endlessly to find something to complain about, you would find yourself enjoying little things like finding out where Kirk's famous speech \"Space, the final frontier...\" actually came from, or seeing how afraid they are of the transporters.  How you can not be slightly giddy seeing  Jonathan Archer pick up a \"Phase Pistol\" and ask, \"What's this?\" These are the nuggets that you are letting slip by because you have this notion that you know what is best for Star Trek.  I have loved all the series'( though Voyager is by far my least favorite) but it was time for something new. One last beef with the fans, lay off the theme song.  I think its wonderful.  This is another one of those preconceived notions we have of what Trek is supposed to be.  Yes, it is different than what we are used to, but if you stop judging and actually watch the images being shown and actually LISTEN to the words, you may find it slightly inspiring. Not to mention the fact that it is actually a very pretty song, that is, when you haven't already canned it because of being close minded.This series is not about the continuation of Star Trek, it is about the beginning of mankind's exploration into deep space; this is why it isn't called Star Trek: Enterprise, but instead it is just Enterprise.  This is not the utopian society of past Trek shows.  These people are flawed, curious, impulsive, and very far from perfect.  They make many mistakes and that is their enduring charm.  They want this so bad and are just learning how to swim.  There are so many other things I loved, such as the grappler and the amazement of a pathetic warp 5, not to mention the fantastic cast and characters (Scott Bakula has always been a personal favorite of mine!,)but I just don't have room to go into detail. So on that note, stop shooting them down before they get going; I have a feeling its going to be one Hell of a ride!  Let's Go!",

The first episode had just over an hour, yet so much happened in it that it could easily be split into 2-3 episodes. But at least it is not boring. It also seems real. And they use command tool for hacking, not one of those super spy CIA graphical interface that you just have to press \"HACK\" and you are hacker .. oh how I hate those. I am not saying this is the way hacking works, but it does seem closer to the real thing more than dumb Hollywood movies. I watch many TV shows and this one really got my attention.

Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson.

I'm glad that I did because this might just turn out to be the next great law show (Justified being the most recent). Have to wait and see how the season turns out.After watching the first episode, you can immediately tell the producers and writers are keen on character development. With the only about half the episode devoted to the first case itself, you'll learn a lot about Sheriff Longmire quickly. That's not to say you won't enjoy it though. This show is VERY watchable. I actually went back and watched it again the next day. A&E hasn't produced a lot of shows I've enjoyed but I'm looking forward to the episode.Set in Wyoming, viewers can expect to see beautiful scenery and the pilot certainly did not disappoint in that sense. Native Americans play a major roll in this show and it seems the hostilities will progress throughout the season. The show focuses on old school methods of law enforcement rather than the recent trend of C.S.I. semen under the fridge kinds that have been dominating in recent years.Give this the show a chance.",

    "top_review": "The Larry Sanders show was the best, nastiest, and funniest comedy program on either side of the Atlantic during the 1990s.  Filmed without a laughter track, it features Garry Shandling as TV talk show host Larry Sanders (motto: \"No flipping!\"), who we follow on and off camera.On camera, the Larry Sanders Show is slick, professional, and vacant, as celebrities appear pretending to be best of friends with Larry and delighted to be on the show when all they're really doing is plugging their latest product and when everyone in the paranoid entertainment industry actively hates everybody else.  Exactly like real talk shows, in fact.  As a parody, Larry Sanders is extremely subtle, aided by the fact that many A-list celebs from real life appear, showing a surprising willingness to send themselves up (David Duchovny, for example, features in one episode where the main storyline centres on his crush on Larry!).  It's bad, but not obviously: you can really imagine it on air (in sharp contrast to Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge, who in real life would never make it even to hospital radio).But the funniest material comes backstage.  The leading characters (Larry, his loser sidekick Hank, and his alternately tough-talking and sycophantic producer Artie) are all so horrible, the main joke is basically that everyone continually behaves in a manner both in character, and yet also worse than you could possibly expect.  The sheer unpleasantness of these individuals is jaw-dropping... you continually wonder \"did he really just say that?\"  Hank, for example, after his agent has been hospitalised and he hasn't been allowed to visit, comments: \"It's so unfair! I mean so much to him!\" then immediately starts phoning potential successors.  The character of Hank is perhaps the best of all, his role on the show is to appear talentless and genial alongside Larry, a role he fulfills with partial success because he is naturally talentless but not in the least genial!  But all the cast (including many regulars) are wonderfully portrayed, Shandling is great but at the end of each brief episode you almost wish you had seen more of the others... in fact this is probably just another sign of the show's strength, instead of wheeling out our favourites each week for a familiar laugh, this show is always looking for fresh ways to make us uncomfortable.In some ways this is a very un-American program (there's not an ounce of sentiment, or a hint of redemption for its characters).  In the UK, Peter Kay's \"Phoenix Nights\" is perhaps the closest thing to a successor. But the Larry Sanders show remains a major loss from the late-night schedules.",

    "top_review": "In these brightly Orwellian days, where cynical governments can smile 'Trust me...' and know we will fill in the blanks 'I'm lying' and not care; where 'biting' satire is left in the sole hands of a cricket-loving impressionist; where the laurel of 'great comedy' is placed on the head of yet another formulaic spoof of fly-in-the-wall documentaries; in these grimly shining times, Chris Morris is a dark beacon of sense, moral fury, fierce intelligence, intransigent vision; a man of endless, astonishing invention, intimidating energy and a gleefully, pranksterish sensibility.The problem with today's 'satire' is that it sets up an 'us against them' opposition, in which we snicker with the satirist at a host of immovable, indifferent caricatures.  Most of our most prominent satirists are of the same generation, background and ideology of the ruling classes, and their humour has the flavour of locker-room ribbing rather than devastating anger.  Most satire consists of an audience talking to itself, reassuring itself of its own worth, its own values against targets so clearly ridiculous they don't really exist.  It is satire as easy listening, as reassuring as old socks.The reason many people don't like Chris Morris is not because of the 'taboo' subject matter he tackles, but because he doesn't play fair, he doesn't play cricket.  He never allows the audience the comfort of complacent complicity.  if we sneer at another hapless celebrity duped into piously anguishing over some preposterous non-issue in an obscene public gesture of their own ethical value and depth, we are stating that we are truly 'authentic', that we would never be caught out, that our values are sound.  And then Morris will insert a crass joke that strips away the warm cloak of lazy irony - an imitation of the author of 'A Brief History of Time', for instance - that repels us, shakes us out of a cosy 'us vs them' mentality, forcing us to face up to the complexity of what we're watching, or - shock, horror! - think for ourselves.When I was watching the 'Brass eye' repeats recently, I was struck by how little they had dated, how exhilirating and intellectually stimulating, as well as cripplingly funny, they still were.  Surely a media satire, with its inbuilt topicality, should become instantly anachronistic.  You could argue that this is a damning indictment of a media that hasn't changed its mind-numbing habits in the last half-decade.  I would argue, however, that 'Brass eye' is not really a media satire at all, or is not one fundamentally, despite its destructively accurate potshots at sensationalism, the paucity of media intelligence, a culture with a media that no longer records or reflects reality, but actually creates it, as in the recent case of a major Sunday newspaper printing photos of paedophiles, encouraging the public to savage  them, conveniently creating the next morning's news.  This is all an essential part of what 'Brass eye' does.But it is more than that.  Morris is our century's Jonathan Swift, and last week's 'Brass eye special' on media hysteria about paedophilia was his 'A Modest Proposal', a satire so savage, so angry, so uncomfortable, so ironic in the true, original sense of that phrase, that people mistook the satire for its object, because Morris held up a mirror to our society, a totalitarian, propaganda-corrupt culture posing as a democracy; and to ourselves, we who conceal brutal, fascist instincts under a guise of ethical concern.  We didn't like it, and rather than acknowledge our own darkness, we tried to smash the mirror.  Like Swift, Morris has always been more concerned with language and ontology than the media per se, the way words no longer mean what they are supposed to mean, in the way the advance of media technology has created an illusionistic world in which 'real' people have to live, in which we try to make the illusion real, to devastating results.  And yet, again like Irishman, the sheer invention with which Morris records this communicative decadence channelled through language, liberates and gives some hope - but only if we accept the challenge of 'Brass eye'.",

My wife and I, who lived briefly in Toronto, are both charmed by Murdoch and his slightly daft colleagues. \"Charmed\" is the word, for we find the actors, scripts, clothing, details and the City of Toronto itself charming. The bigotry faced by a Catholic detective in the city of the Family Compact rings very true as does Murdoch's gentle piety, a refreshing change in today's detective shows. It is a bit mystery, a bit soap opera, a bit character study and a lot of fun. We, at least, have been captivated by William Murdoch as portrayed by Yannick Bisson, a character who is a genuinely honest, gentle and quiet man of strength facing ethical, moral, professional and legal challenges in each episode. George Crabtree and the Inspector become more interesting as time goes on. The corruption of Toronto and Ontario politics hides behind several episodes while the turn of the 20th century fascination with science and \"the coming thing\", as Brisco County Junior would say, gives some lightness to the whole thing. In the final analysis it is the interplay of characters, centred on the troubled but charming Murdoch himself, that elevates the Murdoch Mysteries to the level of Midsomer, Taggert or Poirot. A fine series and not only for Canadians.",

She's exactly the opposite; just Google her and you'll quickly see that she's a huge proponent of civil rights, etc. If you don't know that she's ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints, you don't get it.

You know, sometimes it may worth your while, to actually PAY ATTENTION to what you're doing/watching.If you liked \"Flash Forward\", and got disappointed when it was canceled (surely, due to the kind of feedback I just witnessed), you will definitely love this.

Not only does this program far surpass most of the comedies on television, it has the guts to hit topics that most of the overly sensitive public shies away from. I never understood why it was taken off the air in the first place. Fox can show something as tawdry and humanly degrading as Temptation Island, but Family Guy was too racy? Riiiight.I absolutely must comment on the incredible voice talent done for this show, most especially the amazing creator himself, Seth MacFarlane. First of all, his versatility is unlike anything I have ever heard. When I discovered how many voices he actually performed, I was floored. I am currently receiving my masters in speech pathology so I find his ability particularly interesting. Not only can he speak in these individual voices, he can sing in them, and very well I might add.The musical numbers in this cartoon revive a dying art. The \"Road\" episodes are a hysterical throw back to the Crosby/Hope movies, which is a reference I usually have to explain to my friends though they often must explain a few that I miss. In fact, the scope of the references range from cheesy 80's TV to political commentary to Broadway. This is why everyone will find something funny about this show. Everyone in one form or another can relate to it.Most of my guy friends think I should be offended by the show because I am a woman and this is a \"guy's show.\" Let me tell you, this is not the case at all. Lois Griffin is a freakin role model. I like to think I have half of her savvy when dealing with my ignorant boyfriends.Absolutely excellent television.

Awful.)The new \"B:B&B\" is a clever, fun, and completely refreshing take on Dark Knight and the DC Universe, using Silver Age-style artwork and contemporary snappy patter. Special kudos go to whomever is in charge of the music: rousing, brassy big band numbers that add to the show's flair. The new takes on classic characters like Green Arrow and Aquaman (the best take on Aquaman in television history!) is a double scoop of goodness. Batman is, first and foremost, a comic character, and comics are, first and foremost, supposed to be fun. This series is *FUN*, a real blast to watch.

It's fine and dandy for the country to \"Support the troops\" and what they do overseas. But no one ever takes into the consideration what the wives and families of these soldiers must sacrifice for the same cause. Year long or better deployments, in harm's way, forced into single parenthood, the worry of ever seeing the man you love alive again. As Claudia Joy Holden said in her speech at the July 4th picnic, \"We serve too\". And she's absolutely right. I can't tell you how heartbreaking it is to see women at my church week after week, holding their heads high, keeping it together for their children. And yes, they always manage to bring something for our socials! One woman picked up her child in the nursery shortly before her husband was due home from Iraq and said that her 1 year old was excited about seeing his father...for the first time. If that's not sacrifice, I don't know what is. Watch the show and enjoy it. Don't ruin it for yourself by dwelling on the petty things.

The ongoing careers and lives of a judge, his lawyers, and other officials was probably the best sitcom in the line-up along with The Golden Girls.Unlike today's sitcoms where everyone portrays Woody Allen and has \"sex on the brain\", only one man, ONE MAN, in the cast was thinking non-stop about sexing. John Laroquette, as Dan Fielding; Assistant DA of New York, was brilliant in portraying the sleazy, sexually-addicted hunk. He won 4 Emmys for his portrayal (more then anyone else currently in T.V. comedy will ever hope to win). There were episodes where he alone made the show a gas. But you also have Harry Anderson's Judge Harold T. Stone; who's flair for magic and Mel Torme made him a much-loved star and 6'9 bailiff Nostradamus \"Bull\" Shannon helped make a name for Richard Moll as he played the simple-minded Forrest Gump-type lug that people would want to know. The other cast members were superb as well, especially as soon as they brought in Markie Post as the permanent Public Defender and deadpan comic Marsha Warfield as Bailiff Roz Russell in 1986. The cast stayed together until 1992 and it gelled beautifully.With great stories and lots of hilarity, the show ruled, and although it was adult in nature because of Larroquette's character, it did it in a classy way. You couldn't hate Dan, he just had charm and flair, and wasn't something from \"Friends\". I believe this show is still running on A&E so if you've never seen this classic sit-com, give it a try and see what a sit-com is supposed to be like.",

    "top_review": "DC has always been well known for making fantastic children's cartoons that can be aimed for the hardcore adult fans as-well, bringing nothing but top-notch shows. However, in recent years, it seems that the quality of DC cartoons have dropped. The two main shows that come to mind are \"The Batman\", a terrible show which is clearly aimed at the younger audience, and \"Batman: The brave and bold\", A decent cartoon that isn't on par with classic DC cartoons. However, this cartoon has brought back the best parts of the best DC cartoons and combined them into one. The \"Justice League\" series was fantastic, but as the series went on it was clear that each episode focused on the development of particular characters (Especially in JL: Unlimited) which did not have an ultimate affect in the series. episode was a one-off that usually didn't require viewing of the previous or next episode. Young Justice saw this, and tried to do something new. Firstly, it made sure that the team stays small, like the early days of the Justice League, so that it could make these characters actually important to the plot lines. Secondly, it made each episode a one-off adventure that tied to a single string plot that brought each episode together. JL and JL:U did this a few times, but Young Justice has a clear sense of what's happening in the plot, and what the characters are going through. THIS is why I love Young Justice: it knows what it is trying to do, and it makes you constantly want more.The cartoon style is an updated version of the Justice League's animation style, which shows both seriousness in the tone of the storyline, and the professionalism of the series as a whole. Teen Titans was a 'fun' series, but it was difficult sometimes to accept the serious moments amidst the childish artwork. That's not so much a complaint of Teen Titans, but I appreciate what Young Justice is doing and I prefer it.Voice work is fine, and the music works. Both are easily above par. I actually think EVERY voice is great, even Batman's (even though I am a die-hard Conroy fan, Bruce Greenwood gives a voice I would definitely expect from Batman). There is one exception, though: I was not impressed by the Joker's voice, or his character. I could see they were trying to make him more \"Sane\", but that doesn't work, as the character should be the definition of insanity. However, he only appears once, and the other actors are really good.If you look at my other reviews, you can see that I often give good scores in my reviews. Let me clarify that I am not always giving full marks to what I like, but I prefer to review great shows/movies which I think deserve to be praised. This is definitely a show that deserves to be praised, and I hope the show goes on to be very successful. Bottom line: Fantastic. I would recommend to anyone, not just DC fans.",

    "top_review": "As an older man (55), I'm amazed at the level of graphic nudity, the frankness of the sexual couplings whether gay or lesbian sex is involved, and it struck me as astonishing that the reason I would sometimes be uncomfortable viewing these scenes, is that there are virtually no images for gay people on TV that are comparable to those in QAF. I'm no prude, and thank goodness I've stopped squirming. My normal reaction is that if a series is good in its original British guise, the Americanization will be awful. Not so here. QAF started for me as a superficial soap about gay life. But once the first season was half over, I was hooked. I found I cared deeply about these characters. Their insular gay world in Pittsburgh was refreshing. The relationships work beautifully and you see a fairly representative slice of gay life on this series. Sure everyone always seems to be showing up at the big gay club with its go-go dancers and steamy back room. But how wonderful to have a show all about gay people where nobody gets killed for being gay, or commits suicide or is in some sort of depression or any other negative situations that have been such a feature of films showing gay characters as life's losers. Gale Harold's Brian took me totally by surprise. His no gamesmanship attitude towards sex and relationships makes total sense. What I responded to is his character's absolute refusal to be liked, unlike the very likable Michael (Hal Sparks) whose insecurity demands that he be liked. Brian's a stunning bad boy, confident of his looks, his talent, his ability to spot bullshit a mile away. He wants to be appreciated for his worth. Nothing wrong with that. He's unapologetic about his sexuality and is not obsessed with settling down into domestic bliss the way Michael is. Michael is a child, but a sweet one with his love of comic books, and his unresolved longing for Brian. His character's worry about everything has finally become endearing. Peter Paige's Emmett is adorable and heartbreaking. I love that he's always picking himself up after every romantic disaster, dusting himself off and heading towards the next with high hopes. Scott Lowell has a natural affinity for Ted Schmidt's insecure and manipulative accountant. I'd like him to settle down for awhile. I sometimes weary of his travails. At first I thought Randy Harrison's sweetly beautiful Justin was going to be a fluffy love toy for Brian, but Justin's own problems have shown Brian's caring side, and you get to see that Justin is no dummy. He goes after what he wants. Nothing wrong with that. Sharon Gless's working Mom waitress can be abrasively grating at times, but she presents a loving mother to a gay son, and that's a good thing. Michelle Clunie as Melanie and Thea Gill as Lindsay strike me as an appealing, smart, and caring lesbian couple Their stability as a couple shows what is possible without proselytizing. Now in its fifth season, I've come to appreciate the show in big gulps since I rent each season from Netflix. It's a real wallow, and I'm always sorry that it's over. Right now I'm deep into season four and I can't wait to find out what happens next. QAF is excellent series TV, vastly entertaining. Best of all it won't make you feel dumb.",

    "top_review": "\"Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job!\" picks up the torch that Bob Odenkirk and David Cross dropped when their cutting edge sketch comedy show \"Mr. Show\" was cancelled after four whirlwind seasons on HBO. Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, previously the inventive minds behind \"Tom Goes to the Mayor\", took that torch and set the concept of sketch comedy ablaze.As a genre, sketch comedy has been stagnant for a number of years. MAD TV is horribly unfunny and garish. Saturday Night Live, once brilliant, is now all but completely unwatchable. Several easily forgotten sketch shows have come and gone in the meantime. Gone is the biting social satire of Monty Python and the Dave Chapelle Show.\"Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job!\" attempts to shock life back into the comatose art of sketch comedy with rapid-fire edits, grotesquely memorable characters and crude animation bits all wrapped up neatly in about 11 minutes. It is as if the show's creators have taken every bad public access television clich\u00e9 of the past 20 years and tossed them mumblety-peg into the editing room. The sketches seem ill-conceived and hastily thrown together, as if the show is literally produced just minutes before it airs. Many of the skits lack a clear punchline or point, which is perhaps Tim and Eric's greatest feat of all.The show is actually well scripted and rehearsed. Characters are conceived then fleshed out. The comic timing, in most cases, is painstakingly perfected. By the time the credits roll, one might be unsure of what they've seen or if it was even funny and that seems to be Tim and Eric's point: The joke is on you, audience! Andy Kaufman pulled similar pranks in his stand-up shows. It was nearly two decades before the majority of comedy fans came to realize how brilliant a comedian Andy Kaufman was.As taught by Mr. Kaufman, the only dangerous aspect of comedy like this is that it tends to disorient, confuse, and annoy. It is not immediately apparent that the slipshod manner of each episode's assembly is all part of the gag. \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job!\" has broken the monotony of formulaic sketch shows by using herky-jerky editing to great comedic effect. In that, Tim and Eric, like Mr. Kaufman, may be way ahead of their time. No doubt, advertisers are already taking note and will begin showing commercials in a very similar style within the next few months.\"Tom Goes To The Mayor\" had the most evenly divided audience of any show in the Adult Swim line-up. \"Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job\" seems to be quickly following suit in avoiding viewer apathy which means Tim and Eric (and co-writer/editor DJ Dougg Pound) must be doing something right.",

Like a cross between \"Dick Tracy\" and \"Covert Affairs\", it is not necessary to know the Marvel history behind the characters in this show. Peggy works for a clandestine and patriotic organization (SSR) where she is often treated like most secretaries in the forties. This is one of the basic jokes of the series. Like Clark Kent, she appears mild-mannered, but she works behind the scenes as a lethal and effective weapon for justice and The American Way.The production values are terrific--as in all Marvel stories--contributing to one of the most enjoyable aspects of the show: its immersion in the milieu of its time. The clothing styles. The technology. The idioms.At the same time, the series tweaks technology when it comes to the gadgets that Agent Carter uses in her craft. Her devices are hybrids of forties items and more modern, even futuristic, technologies. Just as steam punk has a special charm, this hybrid technology--which we might call transistor punk--is whimsical and fun.I recommend tuning in to \"Agent Carter\" to watch her strike a blow for America and, along the way, the downtrodden, while swing music plays in the background.",

I'm looking at you cast of Seinfeld. However, I was pleasantly surprised to be completely wrong in this case. This really is a great show that doesn't take itself to seriously. Also, I thoroughly enjoy the soundtrack. But the dialogue is where it's at...

    "top_review": "-- 10/10 for unique story and great characters --It starts simple. Kaneki Ken is an average quiet college freshman who loves reading books and hanging out with his only friend, Hide. The Tokyo they live in is going through a quiet chaos created by human- look-alike people called Ghouls, who live among humans but feed on their flesh. Kaneki doesn't have anyone--no family and only Hide for a friend--which probably makes him the perfect target because nobody will ask about this kid. When he goes on his first date with the girl he likes, he has no idea his life is about to change forever. It is after that night and after he is attacked that Kaneki receives a transplant and becomes a half-Ghoul. He's been human all his life and now one of the basic needs for him to survive has become killing people and eating them. Ghouls cannot eat anything but human flesh; not only human food tastes horrible to them, but it also makes them ill. Ghouls are pretty much hunted by investigators in Tokyo, so Kaneki has to hide his new self, even from his one and only friend Hide. Hide is 'food' now, so what happens if Kaneki starves himself to insanity?The story starts and expands as Kaneki struggles to keep his humanity through his encounter with different conflicting groups--Ghouls that cannibalize other Ghouls, those who kill humans and eat them more for enjoyment rather than need, humans that refuse to accept Ghouls are creatures capable of feeling as much as humans, humans who hunt Ghouls, and Ghouls that believe humans should all be destroyed. Slowly, the story turns into a character study: How far does it take for the innocent to break?I started watching Tokyo Ghoul when I kept hearing the title here and there on the internet, and as you can imagine after the first episode I couldn't stop watching (I read the manga only after the series ended.) If you want an Attack on Titan kind of anime with a solid action plot, you might not like Tokyo Ghoul as much. Yes, it has some great action sequences and a lot (and I mean A LOT) of gore and violence-- especially the last two episodes are definitely not for the faint-hearted. But what makes the show especial is the characters. Kaneki is a great protagonist. He is 'real'. I've watched some series with the main character adapting to their new situation so unrealistically fast. Some might see Kaneki as weak for the way he struggles to become a real Ghoul or remain a real human, and how he's trapped between the two worlds without a place or anyone to go to. But those are features that make Kaneki a real, likable character, and make where the plot heads to so very sad, and equally satisfying.Long story short: Watch Tokyo Ghoul if you love violent, psychological horror stories or/and if you love seeing some VERY good character development.",

Each episode is unique, however, not all are interesting. The first two I saw on Disney Channel made me feel like I was watching Wallace and Gromit again. But as I saw more, I really got into it. It's refreshing after watching cheesy punch lines or the foul-mouthed, sex oriented jokes of other stations.

But with The Goldbergs I was cracking up by the first half of the first episode, I could not resist to write my first review on IMDb.You should ignore some early wannabe critics for hating something about this show. It is brilliantly cast, played and written. The timing of the jokes is spot on. After a few minutes you need to pause the episode to get yourself together again.If you need some references for the style of the show: It's a brilliant mix of Curb your Enthusiasm's angryness and The Wonder Year's nostalgia.Pleas watch the first episode to see it for yourself. The Goldbergs could be the next big thing in comedy.",

First of all what do we learn about prostitution:1) Apparently only good looking guys go to massage parlors with happy endings. Probably because they are the ones with self-confidence issues.2) Guys who do go there respect and admire prostitutes and want to talk about their problems because what they really want is a psychologist.Give me a break.Second of all I have a problem with the main character. I can't feel any compassion for her, because her situation is that she is stupid. I tell you why:1) Why would she buy a house from loaned money? Probably because everyone else does... Banks are nothing more then legit loan sharks. They don't break your leg, but they do take everything you have if you can't pay.2) All right, so she has a mortgage and no money. Why would she drive a gas eating monster? She could have just bought a scooter like Larry Crowne did (you know, in the movie with the same name).3) When things are really tough she becomes a prostitute.

Additionally, it was well written, and one of the few shows able to work seamlessly through numerous cast changes.Elizabeth Montgomery WAS Samantha. No one will ever take her place. She was stunningly beautiful, creative, talented, and convincing in her role. Personally, I don't think she knew how great she really was as an actress. Likewise, Dick York WAS Darrin (yeah, I like 'em neurotic). The chemistry between York and Agnes Moorehead was one of a kind - and the chemistry between Montgomery and York was quite memorable, too. All three were at the top of their game in my two favorite episodes, `Double, Double, Toil and Trouble' and `If They Never Met.' Don't get me wrong, though - Dick Sargent deserves a lot of credit for coming in and taking over a role that had tough shoes to fill.

The irony here is that this MacGyver is actually the cheesy 80's archetype that we all kind of hoped we had left behind. Forget the bad acting, 2 dimensional characters, bad writing, bad effects, bad cinematography, bad editing, etc... The problem with this show is in it's conception as it pretty much takes almost nothing from the original series and just plods along in this paint by numbers for morons garbage.Stuff like this just proves that the risk management department has taken over programming at CBS and will continue to produce this tripe for the foreseeable future.

I simply cannot understand it, and if anyone has any thoughts, PLEASE share them with me!  This show was a breath of fresh air on every level.  If this wasn't a groundbreaking show, it certainly raised the bar sky high.Voices--Many's the time I have thought that they could have chosen a better actor for a part in animation.  Not here.  The voice cast was so good that to this day I cannot imagine anyone else filling the bill.  In the role of Goliath, Keith David demonstrated that he possesses one of the greatest speaking voices of any actor in the business.  Jeff Bennett was also great as Brooklyn, my favorite character.  (Loved the white hair!)Music--Carl Johnson's scores were great.  They beautifully set the tone and underlined the action and the drama.  Animation--Excellent.  Dark, moody and stylish.  The shots of the clan as stone statues are downright eerie at times.  To this day, I still can't believe Disney did this one.Plot--Action, drama, technology, mythology, humor and a little Shakespeare on the side.  Folks, WHAT MORE COULD YOU POSSIBLY ASK FOR?  This series had the most tightly structured story lines ever--there was not a single moment of dead air anytime.The best thing about the series, however, was the characters.  For being a clan of gargoyles (with a couple of humans), these characters were as real as you and I.  Things HAPPENED to them!  They actually got HURT as a result of violence.  They matured, sometimes in ways unexpected.  They found out the hard way who their friends and enemies were.  And they had to live with the consequences of their actions, which sometimes came back to haunt them in later episodes.Here's hoping Disney will realize the error of their ways and bring this show back.  If you are already a fan, may you continue to enjoy the show.  If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.  But be advised:  Once you have seen television and the world through the glowing eyes of a gargoyle, you will never want to settle for \"standard kiddie fare\" ever again.",

The uneasy alliance was shattered when human prejudice provoked a betrayal that allowed the castle to be sacked and most of the resident clan destroyed, leaving only six adult survivors and a rookery of unhatched eggs. A further misunderstanding during the clan's retaliation on the invaders and rescue of their hostages left the clan frozen in stone by a magic spell that would only be broken when the \"castle rises above the clouds.\" For a thousand years, the castle laid abandoned and the clan condemned by this curse.

    "top_review": "My Family is a great comedy. It's rare these days that a sitcom can stand the test of time but this has lasted 4 years all ready ad is still as funny as it was to start with, and it was funny to start with which is also important. It's very exaggerated but very much based in real life and everyone can see trademarks of their own families in the Harpers.The characters are excellent and well portrayed. Firstly there's the mother played by Zoe Wannamaker, who as Jonathan Ross once said, has a strange kind of sexiness. She's the woman with the mad hair and a kind of Witch like, everything in the pot, attitude to cooking, with each episode having her come up with new disgusting recipes like Roast Chicken with chocolate topping. Then there's Ben Harper the father but not head of the household it must be said. Played superbly by another comedic veteran, Robert Lindsey. His sarcastic and biting delivery to everything is hilarious and the banter between him and Wannamaker is the centre piece of the show. Also superb is Kris Marshall as the eldest son Nick, the gormless, unemployable idiot who is the bane of his father's existence.  Marshall plays him superbly and generally Nick has had some of the best scenes in the whole of the run. The most recent series was unfortunate as Marshall has reduced his role to an occasional cameo because essentially he is becoming too old to play the part. Marshall is 31 and Nick is only in his early 20's. Marshall can pass for that because I thought he was Nick's age but also at some point it is inevitable someone aspiring to be a respected actor would not want to become to related to a certain part and become typecast. Gabriel Thompson is also very good as the youngest Harper, the geeky Michael who throughout the series has grown into a sort of amoral shady businessmen, taking friends and family for mugs and making money off them. Daniella Denby Ashe plays the daughter and like Marshall is now an extended cameo. She's the bitchy, spoilt little IT girl who wants things for nothing and is now a mother herself. The newest family member is Abby played excellently by Siobhan Hayes who is another gormless idiot.This is one of the finest examples of recent British sitcom and certainly relatable worldwide. Excellent stuff!",

Of particular interest are the traditions and superstitions of the various crews. You will be drawn in and will find yourself so concerned about a ship that has gone down or about an injured deckhand, that you almost have to keep watching just to find out how things turn out. You will find yourself rooting for your favorite boat as the crab counts come in.Once again, we get to follow the dangerous lives of fishermen hunting for Alaskan Crab. You get to see a first-hand account of several boats journeying hundreds of miles from the beautiful Aleutian Islands into the unpredictably treacherous waters of the Bering Sea. These brave men demonstrate unbelievable endurance as they fish non-stop (day and night). They fish \"derby style,\" which means every boat is competing to catch as much as possible in a fixed amount of time. They hope to earn up to a year's worth of salary in one week in what some call America's last great Gold Rush.This series has the potential to appeal to a broad audience - whether the taste is for action, adventure, sport, drama, documentary, or reality. My friends and family (or even myself) could not understand why a series about crab fishing would be so intriguing, yet anyone who has ever been around while an episode was on always ended up planted on the couch until it ended.",

Chuck, The Walking Dead, Dexter, Sons of Anarchy, 24, House, Supernatural, No Ordinary Family, etc, etc, etc.Now we have Lost Girl.I won't say this show will be enjoyed by everyone, but any sane person will at least acknowledge it is worthwhile. Decent acting shows through a veil of light camp as characters develop personally and with each other. This development is rushed at times, but the point seems to be allow for the audience to quickly absorb as much info as they can on a world with a decidedly massive mythos. Understandably, some may find this up-tempo plotting to be counter- immersive, but there is no accounting for personal preference.Some may be turned away by the sexual energy which charges this show. That being said, the sexuality inherent in the atmosphere is never gratuitous and always essential to the product as a whole.Finally, it must be said that the possibilities for future plot lines are nearly endless, considering the vast amount of folklore this show can draw inspiration from. Not to mention the possibilities of political intrigue between the two major factions in the show.I've tried to be as vague as possible in describing the show, as that is what the summary is for.

Personally though, I think that Jerry Trainor that plays Spencer steels the show. His random lines and insane attitude makes me crack up so much. For instance in the first episode Carly asks him to lend her his camera but he can't because he made it into a squirrel.Overall it's fun and cool and I recommend it to everyone,",

I've always liked LL Cool J and it's nice to see Chris O'Donnell again. (The nerds suck, especially when you consider Abby from the original show.) But it's the presence of Linda Hunt that elevates this show. She's a rich, interesting actor and her character here has a great backstory.Sure this team could be managed by yet another grizzled actor playing a tough as nails former Navy Seal type, whose life has been touched by tragedy because his wife died of breast cancer or his little girl choked on a marble. I'd rather have Linda Hunt because she is a true original. I've seen enough shallow cookie cutter actors with impossibly white teeth and ripped abs.

But PLEASE, give this show a chance! I promise that just one episode of this show will have you hooked. I haven't laughed out loud this much since arrested development (R.I.P.) and the humor is similarly fast paced and, at times, absurd. The show is a half hour long, divided into two 15 minute episodes, which makes the show very watchable even for people who don't think they can devote an entire 30 minutes to a cartoon.Everything about this show is hilarious--the scenarios, the dry dialogue, the buildup to inevitable madness, and the horribly drawn but wonderfully fleshed-out characters. The show follows Tim, who is frequently caught in admittedly outlandish situations, although they always seem to spiral out of control so realistically. He and the supporting cast of characters all have their own stand out performances, including Debbie the friend/hooker and Amy the girlfriend, who is perpetually disappointed in her well-meaning but just plain awful boyfriend. So before you write it off simply because it's an adult cartoon, watch just ONE episode. Hell, even watch one half of an episode. That's 15 minutes of your time that will quickly lead to you watching every episode, I promise.",

But, as spectacular as the potential subject matter might be, it is the inter-relationships between the characters involved in that production that inevitably make the show 'work' -- just as it is in a great musical.There is the blonde 'born to play' Marilyn, and the brunette who just does it oh-so-much-better. There is the conflict between a producer and a director who just cannot stand each other. There are the money problems faced by an executive producer cutting it just a wee bit fine. There's the difficulty producers face running a production 16 hours a day and maintaining any semblance of a home life. Not only is there entertainment value in the acts that make up the musical themselves, but the eye-opening realism of the personal dynamics involved in mounting a musical on Broadway ensure that this program will not run out of steam any time soon.Frankly, I'm just surprised this show didn't happen any sooner.

And sometimes, personal life gets in the way of these professional goals.

    "title": "Party Down", 
    "critic_rating": "8.3", 
    "top_review": "\"Party Down\" is pervasively bleak - and even depressing at times - but it is also riotously funny. In a sense, it's the perfect show for our troubled times - at the height of an economic recession, with all these disasters occurring over the past few years, never has apathy and pessimism seemed so natural. As such, the show really taps into a broken-down, bitter attitude, using the LA wasteland as its source of inspiration...but it remains strangely optimistic because of the relationships between its cast members, whose characters struggle with their awful catering job but, at the end of the day, stick by each other. There's a sense of family amongst these broken-down rejects, and that's why we love watching their weekly miseries.Adam Scott (a seriously underrated actor) is the \"straight man\" for the show - he enters season one as Henry, a new employee of Party Down Catering. He's a failed actor out of Hollywood who has finally accepted that he's too old and past his prime to ever achieve his dreams of becoming a star, so he has resorted to bartending for the company. Scott is wonderful at playing apathetic, and gives some of the best facial expression reactions I've seen in comedy. I'm used to seeing him as the meaner or wackier characters in titles like \"Step Brothers\" or \"Eastbound and Down,\" but here he plays a very empathetic and human character, and is really the heart of the show.Lizzy Caplan is the other relatively normal character in the show. She plays Casey, a stand-up comic treading water. As the season progresses, she becomes romantically involved with Henry, who is essentially her (and our) anchor amidst all the other crazy and eccentric people they encounter.Ron Donald (Ken Marino) is the manager for Party Down, but the show avoids giving us the clich\u00e9d mean boss: he is painfully nice and sincere, with a perfectly goofy Brendan Fraser-style haircut that looks like someone just evened off the top rather lazily. Toward the end of season one he has a bit of a relapse with liquor and by season two his hair has grown out and he's smoking pot and drinking all day and lamenting his failed love life.The rest of the cast consists of geeky Roman (Martin Starr), an aspiring elitist sci-fi writer whose writing actually rather sucks; Kyle (Ryan Hansen), a vain pretty-boy with another ridiculous haircut; and Constance (Jane Lynch), who exited season one to join the cast of \"Glee\" and was replaced in S2 by Lydia, a character played by Megan Mullally, who, it must be said, actually did a pretty good job filling in the void.News spread yesterday that \"Party Down\" was canceled after the season two finale because it barely nabbed 700,000 viewers. Starz mishandled this show from day one, from not securing actors' contracts correctly (Adam Scott, unsure of whether the show would be renewed months ago, joined \"Parks and Recreation\" instead, and Ryan Hansen was also rumored to be moving on) to not really advertising it very much -- and then relying solely on viewing numbers instead of Netflix streams or illegal downloads. (Because they were dumb enough to NOT provide legal downloads on iTunes, which probably would have worked really well for them.) I've heard a lot of positive word-of-mouth lately, with everyone I talk to streaming it on Netflix's website. I don't know a single person who even subscribes to Starz. I'd say 700k views for a season finale on a premium channel that no one watches is pretty good! But I'm actually kinda glad that they went out on a good note rather than running the show into the ground. They provided two very consistent seasons, and with Adam Scott's definite departure from the show, it really just wouldn't have been the same. Hopefully the show will pick up some more word-of-mouth and become a cult hit on DVD, and Starz will do some kind of special a couple years down the road (like Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant did with the British \"Office\") - then the full cast could return. Even though I'm glad the show didn't outstay its welcome, I liked these characters enough to be interested in where they'd be at in a few years. \"Party Down\" is destined to be one of those titles you'll see on critics' \"canceled-too-soon\" lists over the next few years, right up there with \"Arrested Development\" and \"Freaks and Geeks.\" It was a pleasure to watch every week, oddly reassuring in its pessimism, finding humour in the strengths of likable and empathetic characters, even when they were suffering through some pretty rough times. I feel like much truly great comedy finds the truths in common human weakness, causing us to laugh at misfortunes that we can relate to, and \"Party Down\" excelled at doing so.",

Most American shows have a clear good guy (the protagonist) and a clear bad guy (the antagonists).This show, however, follows the Canadian tendency to operate in shades of grey. Continuum presents two opposing factions, and asks the viewer to make up their own mind whether they agree with the protagonist or the antagonists. I'm not speaking from my own interpretation, but the official stance of the people behind the show. The \"choose your side\" mentality has been presented repeatedly in an explicit manner, most recently on the Continuum Facebook page, where a post recently asked, \"Which side are you on? Team Kiera or Team Liber8?\"The show doesn't choose a side, but instead presents an interesting challenge to viewers which some won't be ready to meet: The Freedom Fighters (antagonists) use brutal methods to accomplish their goals, but their cause is just.The protagonist character Kiera operates within the law, uses non- lethal force, does what she thinks is right, and tries to protect people... And yet she champions the cause of despots.Do you believe in the righteous champion of despotism, or the brutal champions of freedom? ...Or do you side with neither?",

Having come in cold not being a PPL fan (although I have seen the first season) I am intrigued by this show. I can see where Pretty Little Liars fans would not like it so much as it is really nothing like that show, this is more paranormal/supernatural, after all the whole town is haunted. I just hope the Caleb & Hanna fans don't try to sink the spin off in order to have Caleb back in Rosewood. He is so much better off here with his brooding persona. Ultimately Ravenswood is a bone chilling tale with a fascinating blend of chills, thrills, drama and mystery but most importantly don't have to be a Pretty Little Liars fan to enjoy the series (in fact you're probably better off not being one) so enjoy this epic tale of pure escapism into the hauntingly eerie town of Ravenswood.",

    "top_review": "\"Whitechapel\" is rather like a Dan Brown novella. What it lacks in actual writing talent, it more than makes up in storyline.The previous commenter skewered this 3-part ITV crime drama, a modernist re-do of the Jack the Ripper murders, but the high scores (9.0 out of 10 at time of writing) tell a different tale. Those who are watching are clearly enjoying this fast-paced, oddly dark series. I suspect this is a reflection on other lacklustre series offered today, as much as its own qualities, but equally it could be because of its ambitious narrative. It's one of those programmes which charms the viewer despite its flaws.Rupert Penry-Jones, he of Spooks/Cambridge Spies and son of television grande dame Angela Thorne, leads a cast of unevenly talented actors who have been given the impossible task of updating the Jack the Ripper murders. But it's not just the crime which has been updated, but for once, so has the copper.Like many \"paper cops\", who have more education than experience, DI Joseph Chandler (Penry-Jones) seems a bit wet to his hard-bitten colleagues in the force. His Savile Row suits, David Beckham haircuts, fashionably large Tag Heuer Grand Carrera Chronograph Calibre 17 watch (Penry-Jones is a big Tag fan), as well as homeopathic remedies for tension -- a mint pomade for the temples -- scream out metrosexual for these 'lager and crisps' men. It's all too much when he asks them to shower and look more respectable in a suit, not to mention actually read whole books on the Ripper murders, which they reluctantly do.East Londoner extraordinaire, DI Miles (Philip Davis), especially doesn't like this new state of affairs. It's possible that he sees a future when policemen will be more like Penry-Jones than the rogue-copper-with-a-heart-of-gold version he represents; he constantly refuses to acknowledge the lad may have some good ideas. His colleagues agree, save for one DI Chandler wannabe, played by Sam Stockman. With his off-the-peg suits, and \"crapuccinos\" (as they are teasingly referred to by others), it seems even the lower orders may desire a more polished style.The series is never bogged down by details of the old Ripper saga, perhaps due to the eccentric Ripperologist who hovers around the story, played to the hilt by the excellent Steve Pemberton. Could the mastermind of the modern Ripper murders, replicated to the exact detail, be none other than a man whose entire life is dedicated to Jack the Ripper? Or perhaps like an Agatha Christie murder, the obvious is too, well, obvious? Whitechapel may have any number of flaws, not the least of which are hackneyed character development, seeming like a cross between Prime Suspect, Morse and cult-classic Edge of Darkness, but it packs a very intriguing punch all the same.",

It could be viewed by older kids, but it had great depths for the adults who took any time with it. Each episode (or couple of episodes) acts as its own mini-movie. The structuring of the story in each one is just so well executed. As well, the animation (for its time) was quite good, and still holds up well enough today. Another difference from other animation, is that the color palette is quite dark- which, again, only makes it more interesting. All of the great villains are here (and others you may not have heard of), but they get a very serious and, at times, philosophical explication. One of my favorite things about the series, is that every episode has its own orchestral score- meaning, the music that you hear is tailored to fit the exact moment you are watching. Shirley Walker manages to come up with so many sub-themes and variations on the main theme- and works them in so well with the happenings on screen. For those of you that have seen the series and remember it fondly, you might be interested to know that a box-set of the first 28 episodes was recently released- you can get it just about anywhere.",

    "top_review": "Ah! Time travel! So many movies and TV series about it. You can do a lot of things with it BUT there are also rules! A lot of things that you can't do. And in the end you are always messing things up. And you must go back and try to fix them, usually to make things even worst!So. Timeless is another light Sci-Fi-ish TV series about time traveling. As it is expected, the show skips the science and goes straight to the formation of an unlikely team and their first mission: Stopping a group of rogue agents who want to change history.There are sooo many wrong things with this concept, yet many movies and series pulled it off, by having interesting plot elements, surprising twists and funny dialogues. Time traveling is (for now at least) just a vehicle for entertainment.Where is Timeless stands in this group? Too soon to tell. The pilot has high production values i.e. good visuals including an OK representation of the 30s (cars, shop, clothes etc.) and a CGI Hindenburg destined to explode. The script though is boringly typical and on the hasty side, also trying to make an impression with phrases like \"wait to see Michael Jordan dunk, and Michael Jackson dance\". There are numerous plot holes too. The cast also is a mixed bag. I like Spencer's acting but I would change some of the other actors.Overall: Another typical Sci-Fi-ish adventure. Light on the Science, more heavy on the fiction. Lots of plot holes. Didn't hate it, didn't loved it. The plot is sub-par but there are hints for a deeper mystery that might get somehow interesting. I'll keep watching ...for now.P.S.// If you wonder about my \"Great Scotty !!!\" title, it is a fusion of Christopher Lloyd's iconic exclamation \"Great Scott!\" (for Back to the Future) and Abigail Spencer's character in \"Suits\" ...Scotty!",

    "top_review": "Newsradio was a fish out of water. In a time of oversexed young white sitcoms, Newsradio relied on brilliant writing, expert character development, and excellent plots to drive it along. No gimmicks needed. Each character had a role to fill, and they filled it well. All of the cast members are excellent, with no misfires. Everyone has classic episodes they like to talk about.Still, as excellent as this is, there are a few minor flaws. For one, Khandi Alexander never got as much screen time as she deserved, and this is no doubt why she left the show. She tried to be a Bill McNeal foil, but Dave served that function already. She seemed like an excellent actress, and her character seemed to be geniune, but nothing ever seemed to happen--in fact, I cannot readily recall any episode where the plot line was based on her save for her departure and maybe some of the Joe-Catherine romance episodes.I like Jon Lovitz, and, unlike others, I found him to be just as capable as Phil Hartman to be in Newsradio. I believe that his performance did, in fact, grow as the last seasoned progressed (watch his hire date vs. some of the later shows--his character certainly changes). He did serve better playing off of other characters, such as Beth and (surprisingly) Lisa, and the few shows that center on him are indeed subpar. Still, some of the best episodes (in my opinion) are in the last season (the apartment hunt, Matthew's 30th birthday, Joe Jitzu), so Lovitz's appearance couldn't have changed the show that much.Some shows just didn't work. Some of the very early ones are heavy on the Dave/Lisa romance, and did use just as many sex-related jokes as other sitcoms of the time. Some shows try to cram three plot lines in one episode, and Newsradio needs time to develop. Some rely way too heavily on Andy Dick's slapstick or Jimmy's over-the-top schemes. And some just don't make sense (the Dilbert episode did little for me).All this, however, is little detriment to the show at large. I would much rather watch reruns of Newsradio than any new sitcoms out there right now. I can't say I blame NBC for cancelling it--pure business reasons; the show wasn't making money for them--but creatively, they blew it.Newcomers may want to watch a few episodes before they cast judgement. It took me a few episodes to really enjoy it. It requires that you know the characters before it becomes interesting and funny.",

Unfortionatley, they got lost in the inter-dimension, and were consigned to wandering between the many parallel universes in the hope of someday finding their way home.When Tracy Torme' and Robert K. Weiss created this show in 1995, they had truly made something special. Unfortionately FOX decided to completely ruin it.They began by airing the episodes out of sequence in the first 2 seasons, meaning that there could be no continuity between episodes, so whenever an extra character slid with the Sliders they were never seen again (with one poor exception). In the 3rd season David \"Peckerhead\" Peckinpah (a man with less talent than a dog turd) became an Executive Producer and many episodes became movie rip-offs instead of 'what if' concepts where parallel worlds had alternate histories to our own. The amazing John Rhys-Davies was then fired mid season 3 and replaced with Kari Wuhrer, a terrible actress who played a terrible character.FOX allowed the Sci-Fi channel to take over the show for its 4th and 5th seasons. They put David Peckinpah completely in charge of the show, and he buried it by having ape-men called Kromaggs take over the Sliders' home world and by rewriting the backstory of the lead character completely. The premise was changed from finding home to fighting ape-men. In the last season, only one of the original Sliders remained.When the show finished, it was without any resolution to many of its story arcs or the final episode's cliffhanger.I feel Tracy Torme's pain. No one could have imagined that they would create a show as brilliant as Sliders, only to see it totally destroyed before their eyes.Sliders had so much potential, but it was ruined by talentless hacks like 'Peckerhead'.The first two seasons and the first part of season 3 are really all that are worth watching unfortunately.",

    "top_review": "Even though Avatar is of American origin, it has a lot of Japanese anime influence, particularly visually, but keeps the best of both animation cultures with it's American sense of playfulness and more realized characterization. The creators of Avatar have really crafted an artistic piece of fun and creative storytelling that is a rare gem for American TV. Avatar has strength in all the major areas of film and story, starting at ground level with an exceptionally believable world setting where war is taking place among the different nations. The main characters who find themselves caught in this struggle are three teens named Katara, Sokka, and Aang (the Avatar) who have set forth to bring harmony to the world through their influence and through the powers of the still developing Avatar. There is lot of humor and fun in this show, and you can't help but to really love these characters and their pets. But this is just the beginning of the glue that keeps you coming back. Great plots and stunning visuals are just as much of importance to the overall success of the show. The story lines are top notch, being both episodic in nature and chronologically integral from one show to the next. Each episode usually introduces a new and genuinely interesting opposition and/or characters to be overcome by the end of the show, and visually there is plenty of awe inspiring backgrounds and quality animation. With just enough well paced action, some sincere points of moral conviction (can you believe it), and witty humor makes the show a winning combination. This is entertainment for all ages, and definitely a must see.",

    "top_review": "If you are going to buy one Conan Doyle DVD let this be it. If you're going to watch a single episode, let it be The Crooked Man.For this is as good as it gets. We have a glorious incarnation of Holmes and Watson here. Brett's Holmes - cantankerous, affected, whimsical, rude, arrogant, precipitous, charming - can only have been drawn from the deepest possible understanding of the text. There have been similar efforts along the same lines, though none so successful. No other Holmes has come close to Brett's portrayal of the brilliant but obsessed mind, teetering on the knife edge dividing madness and genius.Brett's portrayal of Holmes is enough to lift this series above any other. But Granada (who are damn good at this sort of thing when they try) have nailed the two other vital essences of the stories and this makes their achievement unique. Firstly we have a totally new take on Watson, a brisk, wonderfully intelligent man of action, a fearless fellow crime fighter and stalwart support. As David Burke leads Holmes round the Aldershot camp in The Crooked Man, you understand exactly what Holmes found appealing in the bluff ex-soldier, who chronicles his victories, appreciates and learns his methods and soothes his clients when Holme's interrogation causes offence. This is new and unsurpassed. I prefer Burke's to Hardwicke's more thoughtful Watson. Both are top drawer character actors with fantastic credits, but for me, Burke has an impulsiveness and breezy candour that gives his Watson extra light and colour. Hardwicke, in the later series, does a lot more to suggest the difficulty of living with a man like Holmes.An even more significant achievement is the recreation of the deft energy, economy and speed with which Conan Doyle transports his audiences into the heart of Victorian London. Only Dickens did it with anything like the same authority and style. Lovers of the fantastic Sydney Paget illustrations will recognise his work everywhere in the props and scenery. Many of the more famous illustrations are lovingly recreated, but this is really about the chemistry of detail and pace. Granada have the formula just right. So perfect in fact, that when they try to extend it to feature length, it fails, just as Conan Doyle failed in his own attempts to extend the format to novel-length stories. The longer pieces are again, the weakest of the set.If this disk doesn't fill you with delight, go back to the text, read again and look again, or you risk undervaluing one of the greatest achievements of TV drama.Sir Arthur, I'm sure, would have been both delighted and impressed.",

    "top_review": "When I think about the programs that my family enjoyed when my brother and I were younger, this one always comes off as the most memorable, mainly because my family spent quality time together watching this show.  Now, at 20 years old, this show is still as memorable and holds up against the test of time.\"The Wonder Years\" is a period dramedy told from the point-of-view of adult Kevin Arnold (narration of Daniel Stern), and recalls Kevin's adolescence during the turbulent times of the late 1960s and 1970s.  Kevin (played brilliantly by Fred Savage) comes of age in suburbia in a neighborhood that many of our parents (including my mom) grew up in.  Kevin lives in a ranch house with his parents, Jack (Dan Lauria), an accountant, Norma (Alley Mills) a housewife, and his older siblings, hippie Karen (Olivia D'Abo) and smart-alecky Wayne (Jason Hervey).  He has a childhood sweetheart in Gwendolyne \"Winnie\" Cooper (Danica McKellar), and a best friend in lovable geek Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano).  Kevin deals with normal situations that is territorial with adolesence--first loves, heartbreak, middle school, high school, puberty, and growing up.  Kevin grows up in uncertain times, much like children are today.  Each episode is a chapter in Kevin's life, and follows him between the ages of 13 and 18--the most crucial years of growing up.When this show was made, they definitely looked at the lives of teenagers.  The characters were realistic, and no matter when you grew up, you could relate.  Everyone could relate to Kevin, and many felt his adolescent pain.  You knew your parents were overburdening, but realized later that they were only trying to help you.  Everyone had a sibling like Wayne, and possibly like Karen.I'm a product of the 1980s, and being born in 1982 put me out of the loop in regard to what the 1960s and 1970s were really like.  My parents came of age in this decade, so they easily related to Kevin.  The situations were comical, and this show was always good, clean fun.  The humor wasn't overburdening, but it was evident, and we always laughed, but it also impacted you and made you think after it was all over.  This show premired when my brother and I were only 5, and we watched it with our parents every week until it went off the air.  I don't think this show ever was capable of cancellation, but it went out the way it was intended, and it left an indellible impression on this generation.  When the reruns returned to television on Nick-at-Nite in 1998, my classmates and I, already in ninth grade, began to watch again.  Now, I'm a sophomore in college, and if I can catch the reruns on ABC Family during the week, I'm thrilled.  I truly miss this show, and watching reruns brings back great memories.I don't have a favorite episode or memory--I have many favorite episodes and memories.  Two of the moments that I can still remember vividly are when Winnie's older brother died in Vietnam and Kevin and Winnie shared their first kiss, and when Kevin's math teacher died.  My mom, brother, and I always used to laugh (and still do) at my dad, who resembles Jack Arnold.  We could be talking about something funny during dinner, and my father will sit there, stone-faced, much like Jack always did.  I used to love when they'd ask him a question, and he would utter a low growl.  While my dad has NEVER done that, he has always resembled Jack.  Only now, several years later, he finds it funny that we thought that of him.This was a wonderful show that never wore out its welcome, and continues to entertain those who catch the reruns.  If you have the chance in your hectic day, as I sometimes do, catch a rerun or set your VCR to tape an episode for you.  Relive a classic television program that continues to entertain and inspire years later.  You certainly won't regret it.",

I will continue to watch for as long as the producers, directors and actors are willing to avoid shallowness or cave to \"political correctness.\" I'm not a big fan of sex, nudity, or brutality on TV but this story could not be properly told without representing the characters as they really are.Congratulations!

Every Saturday morning, we plopped down in front of the tv and waited for the curtain to rise and for the characters to parade out.  This was before the network started censoring for time and for violence.  Daffy still got shot in the face. Sylvester had anvils dropped on him.  Wile E. Coyote fell off cliffs and was blown up by dynamite.  Bill Watterson summed it up best in \"Calvin and Hobbes,\" \"This is what entertainment's all about...idiots, explosives and falling anvils!\"This was the place to see Duck Dodgers battle Marvin the Martian, see the great French lover attempt to woo a painted cat, catch a tweety bird wallop a lisping cat,observe the fastest mouse in all Mexico, and learn to never buy anything from a company named Acme.Years later, when Saturday morning was a day to sleep in, not a ritual to be observed (starting with a test pattern, and ending when American Bandstand came on); I caught the updated version of this show.  The cartoons had been edited to the point that the humor was lost.  The timing of the jokes was destroyed.  Political correctness caused some characters to disappear. Even now, you won't see Speedy Gonzales on the Cartoon Network; and, although Daffy does get shot when it's duck season, he doesn't shoot himself in the head to sell the script for the Scalet Pumpernickle.  Speaking as someone who devoured these cartoons and others as violent, I never once imitated anything I saw on the screen.  The fact that I was watching a talking rabbit was enough to show me that this wasn't real.  Anyway, it's been my experience that kids are always smarter than network executives and censors.I bought all the tapes I could find of these cartoons when they were on video; now Warner is finally going to release dvd compilations.  Here's hoping that the cartoons will be intact, the way I remember them.  Now, \"Overture/Curtain! Lights!/This is it/The night of nights....\"",

The series was an answer to \"All in the Family\". It showed the differences and similarities between white blue-collar society and the working class African-American. It also was a coast war as \"All in the Family\" took place on the Atlantic shore while \"Sanford and Son\" took place on the Pacific.

Fred also showed overt disdain for his sister-in-law, Aunt Esther (the feeling was mutual). Many times, Lamont threatened to leave for meaningful work, but Fred faked a heart attack each time (\"Oh, this time its real, I'm a-comin' 'Lizabeth!\") as a sympathy ploy to get his son to stay. By 1977, Fred and Lamont had sold their business (stars Foxx and Wilson wanted to leave the series); it became ...",

    "top_review": "I will just start by saying that this is nothing like the book (which I like) and it is done in an excellent way. They basically just took the names and two or three basic ideas, but that's it. Even the Main Character has a different background and skills. The premise is that there is an unhappy boy who wants something and finds a magic school. Sounds a bit... used. But:1) Magic is a tool that the show uses, not a goal in and of itself.2) The show focuses on many characters instead of just one and it develops their personalities and interactions, independently from the Main Character.3) The pacing is really good of the show. They cover surprising amounts of subjects in one episode - this is not a show where they will make you wait for the finale for something exciting.4) What they do is dangerous and people get hurt. Also, magic takes a lot of effort - you don't just say a word and wave a wand. 5) They curse and do not get always get along, and they smoke, sure, but they don't make a big deal out of it. It's not a prude show, but it's not a Spartacus/GoT show (blood & tits) either. 6) The first season has 13 episodes and SyFy has already renewed it for another season. So you won't just start a show, just to see that they cancel it at the end of the first season. I'd personally recommend it if you are into fantasy. It's not exceptional, but it is good and it got me hooked up and wondering what will happen next. This is why between the first and the third episode, the 18-34 audience has actually been growing.",

    "top_review": "Network: Comedy Central; Genera: Comedy/Sketch; Content Rating: TV-14 (for strong language and sexual content; Classification: Contemporary (Star range: 1 - 4)Season Reviewed: 5 seasonsFrom the outset, a full-length parody of 'Cops' wouldn't sound like any groundbreaking comedy. With it's well known traditions and often copied style, 'Cops' has long been the subject of parody for years before arguably becoming a parody of itself. However, 'Reno 911!' does you one better. From Thomas Lennon, Kerri Kennedy and Ben Garant - the creators of 'The State' and the now forgiven and forgotten 'Viva Variety' - 'Reno' takes that 'Cops' mold (and 'Rescue 911!' title sequence) and populates it with a world of realized original characters. In 'Reno' this comedy troupe has found a perfect cross between the improvisational sketch comedy series and the episodic televisions series. The show, as you might expect, is largely improved which can be good or bad (as seen in last year's disastrous 'Life with Bonnie'). The show's hit-and-miss laugh ratio is lower than it probably would be if it was scripted, but what we gain in the trade-off is this wonderful naturalistic dialog. The crew have an ear for recreating that often witty but just as often dull, monotonous and uncomfortable naturalistic conversation. If 'Reno' were any funnier it would be in the stratosphere. I love the opening title sequences. The entire cast is note-perfect. We have straight-laced Jonsey (Cedric Yarbrough), Garcia (Carlos Alazraqui), a racist, lonely, complex shell of a man, Clementine (Wendi McLendon-Covey) is the truck stop waitress turned cop \"with a full dance card\", Junior (Garant) is the incompetent, fully of stories, young cadet and Rainessha Williams (Niecy Nash) is the sassy, booty-licious femme-fetal cop. The show bounces all these characters off each other, matching them up in odd pairs and letting the nuances in them create the sparks. Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kennedy have given themselves the juiciest roles and approach brilliance in them. Kenney's Trudy Weigel is superbly dysfunctional beyond any simple description and Lennon's Jim Dangle is poised to be the breakout character of the show. Like Mr. Garrison in 'South Park' and Stewie Griffen on 'Family Guy', Dangle is a character than can get a laugh from me almost anytime he opens his mouth. It has a knack for creating scenarios where, in an odd way, the set-ups can be funnier than the punch line. Just the idea that Jim Dangle is going to show up to Trudy Weigel's house and \"give her the thrill of her life\" is funnier than ultimately seeing the Asian man she's hiding in her kitchen.'Reno' knows its way around the 'Cops' traditions, making ample use of streakers with strategically placed edit blurs (also brilliantly hiding the faces of the cast doubling up), belligerent roadside pull-overs, hookers with bad wigs and crazy domestic disturbance calls that reveal fetishes best kept behind closed doors. But it also knows it needs to be more than that. The episode plots are as hilariously strange as it comes and veiled thinly enough to support any number of tangential gags. In one episode the group is put on suicide watch for Trudy Weigel and she flips out because they look disappointed she didn't go through with it. In another, they venture to the Burning Man festival and get lost along the way in full rave gear. In a particularly inspired episode they compete for 2 tickets to an execution with a suspect scavenger hunt.The bumbling officers get visits from the FBI, Homeland Security, British officers and in 2 classic episodes a religious tele-evangelist and Reading Ron (Brian Unger) featuring a show-stoppping bit with a cat on a roof. Watch continuously and you'll see running gags and continuity coming out in what otherwise seems like randomized chaos. These cops view enforcing the law as a happy side effect to the real joy of holding their power over the citizens of the burned-out Nevada suburb, abusing it gleefully and not above pulling guns on themselves. 'Reno 911!' was originally produced as a pilot for Fox and sat on the shelf for 2 years before Comedy Central came calling (and it became an almost instant hit). Sounds like something Fox would do. It's all for the best as 'Reno' on Comedy Central is given free range to do things every week that would have gotten them throw off the air at Fox. Jokes around rape, accidental shootings, cops planting evidence and screwing with the citizens (in a time when the media loves to put a wedge between cops and the people), red-necks & every racial demographic known to man, discussions on when it's appropriate to use the N-word, terrorists in the post-9/11 world (with the greatest of ease I might add, a subject most shows trip over themselves to run from) and everything else you might imagine would give a network suit a conniption fit are peppered well into the show. It enthusiastically leapfrogs from one set piece to the next in an attempt to offend anyone and everyone it can and getting big laughs with it. I largely consider Comedy Central a dumping ground, but admire their drive to take chances - which is more than you can say for the networks. 'Reno' is a show that isn't crude for the sake of it or the edgy in appearance only. It is a gutsy, frequently hysterical series in which the gags are expertly delivered (and edited together) by a well developed cast of comic talents. A real screwball farce that roams freely around without politically correct borders or boundaries, the likes of which you just don't see much of on TV today. And you want, silly slapstick? 'Reno' proves that even the age-old kick-in-the-groin gag, if done well, can still be funny. An acquired taste, but well worth it.* * * / 4",

A TV series that you can get into from the first episode and by the end you know what's up. No need to watch the first 5 episodes before it all starts making sense. It's realistic and therefore it appeals to a lot of people even though most people haven't lived that sort of life or know celebrities for that matter. We know enough through the tabloids, TV, news, internet, etc etc. to know how some people can't carry the weight of success and they end up on the wrong side of history. We've seen many examples and of course we have also seen people that handle it pretty well too.Whether they are athletes, actors or singers or whatever, they are all subjected to all sorts of seductions, schemes, paparazzi, and of course freeloading people around them. In that respect the series is very realistic. It is of course laced with predictable outcomes by that's all fine as they still make it all very enjoyable and easy to watch.The actors they picked are very good for the roles they play so i don't see the negativism that some people have. Maybe they expected Grammy award plots, i don't know ...It's just great entertainment, beautiful people & cars, good music, tight dresses and tailored suits and no psychic bloating.My only point of criticism is that each episode is too short. It should be twice as long (50 instead of just 25 minutes).",

Firstly: when these novels are adapted for the screen, fundamental elements of the plot are excised or replaced, and this is true of even the better King-flicks (\"The Shining\" and \"Carrie\" are just as guilty as pulp trash like \"Needful Things\" and \"Cujo\").   \"The Tommyknockers\" begins as if it's going to buck the trend, establishing the majority of the usual King misfits early on, and actually adds a little suspense by not showing its hand too early - for example, this adaptation does not make clear what's buried out back in Bobbie's farm straight away.   But as the town begins to be affected by said item, it's off into it's own world, and toss the novel out the window.   Granted, some of the more imaginative gimmicks the township dreams up cannot be translated to screen with the appropriate panache, especially with the meagre budget allocated to this project - but does everything need to look so cheap?   Much of the dialogue at best doesn't ring true, at worse stinks.   Witness the actually quite good Marg Helgenberger delivering some awful lines (\"Gard, let's experience it together!\") but in an offhand way that suggests that she's really aware that she's not in a Mamet play, but, Hell, let's make the best of it anyway.   Any good points?   Well, Joanna Cassidy is always worth watching, but an actress of her class still can't make a thrown together middle-age romance look realistic.   Helgenberger and Allyce Beasley come out of it with the least mud sticking.   Worst crimes? Jimmy Smits completely miscast, terrible dialogue, cheap effects, complete massacre of the source material, Traci Lords all at sea outside of a John Waters movie or skinflick ... the list goes on.",

I'd like to suggest more cynical viewers lower their proverbial gun barrels and take pleasure in a show that simply wants to be silly, creative and a little bit cheesy...as opposed to the barrage of deep message-laden pseudo-preachy programs that we're currently bombarded with.I found the pilot a bit shaky in spots, but I can't recall a pilot of any program where this wasn't the case. The characters were well-portrayed; I found the acting particularly strong given the subject matter. It also had a decent spectrum in relation to how it will relate to adults and younger viewers; hence the steady-fire logic of visual and vocal quips that kept things rolling along nicely.I'm trying to be as vague as possible as I'd rather entice people to check it out, instead of spoil it by trying to summarize or describe it adequately in text. It's a situational-style sitcom with Sci-Fi overtones. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and clearly has a lot of fun in the production. I found the writing particularly clever in many spots, and laughed out loud on many occasions. I can only hope the humour and writing stays strong throughout the season, because if that starts to weaken, it may deflate the whole concept altogether. Nonetheless, I've found it to be a decent breath of fresh air so far.",

    "critic_rating": "8.1", 
    "top_review": "Looking for a tl;dr version? Here goes - TAWoG is a show of fantastic production quality with writing that's all over the place. When it works, it soars above all expectations; when it fails, it's practically unwatchable.* * *Here's why. From the first piece of promotional art I saw back in 2010, I was instantly drawn to the unique visual style cooked up by France's Ben Bocquelet, the mastermind behind Gumball's world. Almost every character looks like they were pulled from a completely different source, with some characters drawn in a traditional cartoon style, while others are puppets, CGI, 8-bit sprites, or even live action (which is also used for the backdrop of the show) - and stills from the show don't even come close to describing how much eye candy is packed into every frame. If you've only seen the show on Cartoon Network, I recommend that you look up the show's (conspicuously missing) theme song online, as it's great example of how much energy and creativity the crew has. Watching this show is the remedy I needed after the visually offensive \"The Problem Solverz\" ravaged my fragile cornea.Aurally, the show almost reaches the same height of excellence. Although the voice actors are more than passable, the most enjoyable part of the show's audio experience is the soundtrack. The score is bubbly, cheery, fun - and when called for - epic.The problem is that, under the fantastic visuals, music, and production value, the writing (especially the humor) can be quite lackluster, sometimes fatally so.The most frequently recurring problem is simply a lack of originality. Despite the trippy visuals and wacky characters, the show's basic structure is your run-of-the-mill school sitcom. The plots are recycled, the characters clich\u00e9, and the outcomes predictable. The most glaringly obvious example is the main family, the Wattersons, who are about as unoriginal and tired as possible. You have the idiot father (think Peter Griffin crossed with Homer Simpson and Dick Daring) who can't do anything right, the genius kid (Lisa Simpson, maybe a bit a Stewie Griffin?), the voice-of-reason mom, and the trouble making boys. If you're looking for a show that subverts the \"smart girls, dumb boys\" dynamic, you had best look elsewhere. The father is especially poor, moving past simple incompetence to complete mental retardation at points. At times I found myself wishing he was either more like the stay-at-home dad on \"Johnny Test,\" which is a terrible thing to want, or not in the show at all.Predictably, the show works best when working with character traits and quirks that haven't been lifted wholesale from previous shows. The mother, Nicole, is bi-polar, and occasionally transforms into a suburban ninja of sorts. Even more importantly - perhaps the saving grace of the whole show - is that the titular Gumball is a refreshingly endearing male lead. Although he gets into loads of trouble, he isn't an extreme jerk like Johnny Test. The way the writers craft Gumball's dynamic with his adopted brother, Darwin, and girlfriend, Penny, can reach teeth-melting levels of adorability.But again, this creates quite a large problem, this time with the show's humor. Bafflingly, the writers seem to think the best way to get laughs out of the audience is to take young Gumball and destroy him emotionally and physically in practically every episode. From being abused by his classmates, laughed at by his mother, and patronized by his sister, Gumball's cavalcade of suffering is usually the focal point of the show's surprisingly mean-spirited humor. And it barely ever works. The end sequence of the episode, \"The Gi,\" is practically unwatchable due to the amount of public humiliation and pain inflicted on Gumball. Although the episode has a maddeningly cute happy ending, it feels disingenuous when compared to the mean-spirited tone preceding it.Like with the characters, though, there are a handful of episodes that avoid this routine, and the difference in quality is astonishing. If you want to see the best Gumball has to offer, seek out the episodes, \"The Dress,\" \"The Pressure,\" \"The DVD,\" and \"The Third.\" Here the humor is based more on dialog, surprisingly adult innuendo, and interaction between the characters rather than cheap slapstick and cringe-inducing humiliation.If the bad parts of this review seem too harsh, I would only say that it stems from the fact that the good episodes of TAWoG are so good, enjoyable, cute, and funny, that the bad ones stick out like a hand of sore thumbs. I can only recommend that you don't give up after a single viewing, since the quality of the show's writing varies vastly between episodes.EDIT: tl;dr: The show got much better in season 2 and 3. Go watch it and be entertained.* * *Years later, I felt the need to edit this review, since some of the grievances I had have been more or less addressed in the second season of the show. Gumball's scrappier and less prone to abuse and manipulation by his peers and family, and the humor moved away from abusive slapstick to focus more on cartoon physics, sight gags, and 4th-wall breaking. The visuals lost a smidge of their original wild abandon in exchange for a much cleaner, consistent (and still amazingly pleasant) aesthetic. There are less genuinely adorable moments, but the tone of the show is just nicer overall. There's still plenty of cutesy gags and dialog to keep a goofy grin on your face while watching. The exceptions, unfortunately, are still Anais and Richard, who continue to be inexcusably mean and stupid respectively. How anybody could enjoy them still eludes me. Season 3 really goes down hill after The Shell, though. Stop making Gumball so stupid, Ben.",

And it doesn't need to in order to get you to love its main character. You just do.Michael C. Hall can play any emotion he's handed. Jennifer Carpenter fits her character perfectly, as does everyone else in the cast.Then there's the actual story lines. It's not clich\u00e9. It's actually scary and chilling. It keeps you guessing. It's one of those mysteries that is very difficult to solve, but it still keeps your interest.'Dexter' can also be hilarious when it wants to be, depressing when it wants to be and especially thrilling when it wants to be.

    "critic_rating": "8.6", 
    "top_review": "1950's television was pretty bland by almost any yardstick. That's not to say that certain series, such as the early Gunsmoke, were not daring and edgy in their own way. Or that the early I Love Lucy did not have its hilarious moments. However the governing concepts were unadventurous at best, or just plain dull, at worst. After all, no matter how good some of the episodes, bringing law and order to the Old West or following the humorous escapades of a zany housewife were not exactly novel concepts in TV programming.Two series, however, did come along to challenge convention. The Twilight Zone, at decade's end, attacked frontally with huge doses of imagination and exotic story-lines that often overwhelmed viewers, thereby opening American living-rooms to the expanding world of unthought-of possibilities. It was, and remains, a classic appreciated by young and old alike. However, the other ground-breaking series did not attack frontally. Instead, in true stealthy fashion, it snuck past the guardians of Good Taste and Morality, otherwise known as the department of Standards and Practices. That's probably because each episode was introduced by a funny-looking fat guy with a British accent, who came out to crack a few bad jokes and abuse the sponsors. Who could suspect that what followed such a slow-talking Humpty-Dumpty would subtly undermine some of TV's most entrenched conventions.Yet that's exactly what the Hitchcock half-hours did. Perhaps the most subversive change lay in the series's really sneaky treatment of wrong-doers. To that point, convention insisted that culprits be apprehended on screen, the better to teach the audience that Crime Doesn't Pay. And while that may have conveyed a comforting societal message, it also made for a very predictable and boring climax to even the best stories. What the Hitchcock show did that was slyly revolutionary was to transpose the comeuppance from the story to Hitchcock's often humorous epilogue. There the audience would learn that the culprit was duly punished and that justice had once again prevailed, apparently enough to keep the censors of the day at bay. So the story-line might end on screen with a grotesque murder, while only later would the audience be told by Hitchcock that justice had indeed caught up. Maybe that seems like just a minor change. But in fact, it was highly significant. For now the audience could follow plot developments, without knowing how the story itself would end, while the deadening element of predictability was transferred to the easily ignored epilogue. It was a truly ground-breaking event in the evolution of TV.All in all, that element of uncertainty made for the kind of programming that continues to entertain, even into today's super-charged era of technicolor and relaxed censorship. It also accounts largely for why Hitchcock Presents remains one of the few series from that long-ago time to still be re-run. There were other sly subversive wrinkles such as the black humor that sometimes accompanied the most heinous crimes. Or the subtle insistence that murder often begins at home. In fact, the series as a whole managed to mirror much of Hitchcock's movie-making personality, which suggests the producers (Norman Lloyd and Joan Harrison) were very protective of what the Hitchcock brand name implied. Anyway, like any other series, some episodes were better than others, but only rarely did one really disappoint. In fact, the high quality remained surprisingly steady throughout the half-hour run, before dropping off noticeably during the over-stretched hour-long version.Some of my favorites: \"Mr. Pelham\" (good semi sc-fi); \"The Creeper\" (suspense & fine acting); \"The Glass Eye\" ( well-done horror); \"Back for Christmas\" (typical Hitchcock irony); \"Poison\" (you'll sweat a bucket load); \"Design for Loving\" (off-beat premise well executed); \"Human Interest Story\" (Hitchcock meets the Twilight Zone); \"Special Delivery\" (truly spooky); \"Specialty of the House\" (It ain't Mc Donalds); \"Breakdown\" (Why don't they hear me?), and anything with the deliciously repulsive Robert Emhardt.I'm sure there are many others not so fresh in my memory. Anyway, in my book, a big thanks is due Alfred Hitchcock for doing something no other movie heavy-weight of the time was willing to do. He risked his big league reputation by squeezing into millions of little black boxes once a week for seven years to bring the audience outstanding entertainment. His snooty peers may have sneered, but generations of grateful viewers have since proved him right.",

Then they brought in Florence as the maid played by the hilarious Marla Gibbs, the sparks flew between her and George. Not those kind of sparks but a funny rapport between the two to last for years. The show explored everything like interracial relationships and race with tact and dignity. My most memorable moments from the show were about George being secret Santa to a Harlem family who now lived in his building. But then who could forget George opening the George Jefferon Museum. I am glad to watch this show again one night a week on a local station which pays homage to the seventies shows like the Jeffersons. The show had a stellar supporting cast like Roxie Roker and Franklin Cover as the interracial couple, the Willises, who become dear friends of the Jeffersons. Isabel Sanford passed away about a year ago. She was the first African American woman to win an Emmy for Best Leading Actress in a Comedy Series. She was very worthy to be a pioneer for the rest. The fact that Sanford was twenty years older than Helmsley is fascinating. Isabel always looked fabulous and younger than her actual age. I miss Isabel. She was one of a kind!",

Any person with a basic knowledge about India and it's religion / culture would simply ridicule them. 2) 90% of the times they said \"Ancient Sanskrit writings of India\", they actually showed Ancient Tamil / Telugu writings. They are as different from each other as Latin, Aramaic and Icelandic are from each other. When they spoke about India, it's so funny; each time flashed the same couple of temples which are in South India.3) Kumari Kandam had been explored for in the Bay Of Bengal in the extreme south of the east coast (Mamallapuram in Tamilnadu to be precise). They said that they found ruins of Kumari Kandam in the Gulf Of Cambay which is in the west coast and at least 1200KM from the actual site.4) Also, one old bald guy in the second season who speaks like he knows head and tail of the Sanskrit scriptures said \"there are as many as 400000 intelligent civilizations in the universe including other dimensions\", which is total bull. No such mention anywhere LOL!!!5) Dwaraka, a 30000 BC site? No one could find a carbon-datable artifact in the under-water archaeological survey of Dwaraka or the Gulf of Cambay. That's just a made up arbitrary number. 7000 BC was the actual estimated time the place sunk in the sea.These people are so content with their fantasies that they forgot to look for any factual information.

I remember when I was little watching the reruns on TNT and TBS, and now own the complete first season on DVD.  I don't know why it is, but I've always had a special place for \"Gilligan's Island,\" it's one of my favorites.  True, you can't take too many clothes on a 3-hour tour realistically, or how in the world can you do everything from build a hut to a lie detector, but can't make a fail-safe raft?The ratings, in all its three seasons, shone high above many shows; despite the network's attempt of changing the time slot a few times.  It beat Bonanza in its first season, and by the end of the third season, it had beat Star Treck, The Monkees, etc.  If William Paley's wife hadn't loved Gunsmoke, \"Gilligan's Island\" would have easily gained at least two more seasons by ratings alone.If you're looking for sophisticated humor, this show isn't it.  It's silly, corny, but the cast is just a lovable one.  You can't help but like the series (which is more than I can say for \"Green Acres\"; which gets annoying after a few episodes).  The cast is brilliant in their roles, and the chemistry between Alan Hale Jr. and Bob Denver and Jim Backus' chemistry with Natalie Shcaffer is perfect.  All in all, \"Gilligan's Island\" is just pure clean fun, which is more than I can say for shows on today. Watch it, give it a chance, and enjoy!",

I assumed it would employ pointless sexuality, unrealistic dialogue (done in cheesy southern accents), and plot points that ventured outside of likelihood.And then I found out that the creator was the screenwriter from \"Thelma & Louise\" and that most (if not all) of the actors and actresses had pristine track-records when it came to their choices (Connie Britton's work on \"Friday Night Lights\", Hayden Panettierre's work on \"Heroes\", etc. etc. etc.), not to mention having music produced by some of country music's hottest. I decided, \"What the heck?\" and decided to give the show a shot.Every aspect of the show blew me away, from the opening shots of Nashville (I'm a Tennessee native myself, so it's always refreshing to see my great state shown in such a marvelous light), to the wonderful performances of Britton and Panettiere and other cast members, to the knock-your-socks off music (none of your Glee original music here; this is some high quality country!...which is saying a lot, as I am not a huge fan of country music), to the SUBTLE sexuality which--in my opinion--outdoes the blatant sexuality every time.In all, I found this to be one of the most promising shows (if not THE most promising show!) of the 2012-2013 season, and I cannot wait to tune in each and every Wednesday.Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!",

    "top_review": "What Andromeda does well:1. The cast is, on the whole, quite good.  Kevin Sorbo is the solid core (typical) central character one expects in this type of story, but the other characters are generally original and well-played.  I especially like Harper and Beka, who manage to be fresh and compelling without being so iconoclastic as to distract the viewer from the plot.  I also like that Rommie is not only an AI \"learning to be human\" but is also The Ship.2. Backstory and plot are as interesting as any sci-fi franchise on television.  The tale of Dylan's having been \"stuck in a singularity\" for 300 years, while scientifically suspect, makes a good yarn.3. Effects and art direction are up to the best modern syndie TV can offer:  benefitting from the advances in computer tech while likewise suffering from the vague sense of unreality it creates.Where Andromeda falls short:1. As the biggest \"power that be,\" Sorbo has a slight tendency to overstress his character's importance.  Dylan is, of course, the most important character, but as a fairly stereotyped \"strong, silent captain,\" he's far from the most interesting character.  The other characters should not only be allowed to carry some episodes, they should also be allowed to \"be the hero\" in more stories, even when Dylan is also featured.  No captain, no matter how heroic, is always right.2. Individual episodes are hit-and-miss.  Not only are occasional episodes not much fun to watch, they don't even have much to do with the ongoing story.  While I recognize that we can't get a barnburner every week, we do need *some* reason to tune in, whether it's humor or romance or whatever.3. Not every unique touch has played out:  Rev Bem was interesting in conception but not really in execution.  I don't fault Brent Stait; I just think a Magog monk was compelling for about a week tops.  I don't really mind that he was written out (for whatever reason).  Another character who has failed to reach critical mass:  Tyr.  KHC is a good actor and undeniably an impressive physical specimen, but as the seasons have gone by, Tyr has never really developed much beyond a surly, untrustworthy bore.  I think the problem lies largely with the concept of Nietzscheans in general; to make him more interesting, they would necessarily undermine the underpinnings of the character--it's a catch-22.  I'm also underwhelmed by the \"new Trance.\"  The character as originally played was enigmatic and sweet; now she's just confusing.4. Season 3 already misses the \"rebuilding the Commonwealth\" story thread.  While the stories this year have been interesting, the show lacks dramatic impetus.  Now that they're not concentrating on preparing for the Magog invasion or on strengthening the Commonwealth, they seem to be floundering around a bit.  The plot lacks direction.All told, I like Andromeda as much as anything on right now.  But I can't help but feel it's not living up to potential.  I'm afraid they may be trying to please a focus group rather than trying to make compelling television.",

    "top_review": "There is no possible way that this show is only getting a 6.4 rating at this time. Something must be wrong. Usually I trust IMDb's rating system. Anything over 7.5 for movies is typically a good movie, above 8.0(Oscar potential) a really good movie.. Anything over 8 for TV shows also typically means its a good TV show and above 8.5 would suggest its really good(Emmy Potential). I was expecting an average of 9.0 for this show.This show actually reminds me of another show \"Traveler\"(2007) with Matt Bomer as it had edge of your seat drama and action and was very entertaining .. its about a guy \"Will Traveler\", an agent who gets mixed up in a conspiracy. the show was on ABC and it was an amazing show but this show actually had good reviews.. unfortunately it didn't last either. But is definitely one of the better shows that got canceled in the past decade..So, in saying that it could be that Missing just off to a slow start.. And, critics may have derailed the show from the start. I've read some of the harshest critiques by critics regarding this show that I have ever read in my life. I am stunned. I never have been so bewildered over such harsh ratings. I guess critics don't like it not being original - And starts off like the Movie \"Taken\" except genders are reversed. That doesn't matter one bit.. The acting is good. The story is good. It's exciting and entertaining. And, Ashley Judd kicks butt!! And kicks it well.I am very familiar with the writings of shows, different story arcs, plots, sub plots, direction, etc.. And have become a rather good judge of character for a TV show knowing fairly soon even sometimes before the show airs if it will be canceled. I'm no pro, or no critic, but I do know the negative remarks on this show are dead wrong. The writing is superb and very tight, leaving nothing unchecked and nothing feeling forced. when writing is this good, shows will last. Many blast the Director but I think he's done a good job too.. so far, I have nothing negative to say about this show. For all the crap that's come out and been canceled already within a few episodes airing, this by far has been the best new show on PrimeTime Television since shows like 24, Lost, Desperate Housewives, Monk and Burn Notice first aired.. (that's how much I like it so far..) It just seems to be that the critics may have won and pushed off so many viewers from the start. One thing is certain, as one critic said ..\"its so unbelievable and hard to watch a woman killing off all these other men who are supposed to be well trained agents\". well, I say \"who cares\"? Was Lord of the Rings believable? Was the TV show \"Heroes\" believable? I bring up these fantasy type plots b/c that's what TV and movies are all about.. Stories of the unbelievable that make it entertaining.. I for one like to see a hot chick kick some......Then another critic when on to complain about it not being original and said ..\"the creators of Missing should have taken another look at CSI, Law & Order and 24\"... Ummmmmm didn't he just say that it lacks originality? Then went onto say it should have been like those other shows? I do think this show is in part original - its all character and no technology at play. Just good old fashion fighting, action and drama and just a few main characters to keep it tight.I highly recommend it and rarely have such great things to say about a show. One thing to point out.. I also am aware of reviews bad or good setting expectations for a show. For instance, I'll tell my friends a movie is very good that when they see it, I set the expectations so high they didn't like it. Same can be said for when you hear a show isn't good, then it turns out to be the opposite. However, sometimes when critics say such harsh things right off the bat, the show rarely gets a fair chance. I for one am so tired of these lame shows coming out on television..(thank god for USA and AMC for having the best shows on television..) I look forward with high anticipation about the outcome of this show..",

It was epic but I think most of you are stuck on the feeling you had while watching it as a kid to what the show actually was.Dragon Ball Super to me, feels the same. It reminds me of the originals. It is fun, quirky and at times slightly goofy. The story starts great bringing the cast in full view and giving a little bit of back story. I never expected it to come out in full force with epic battles in the first few minutes. I personally like a story, the originals had a great story not just epic battles. Even other great anime have great story with lots of filler. I think people have had too many expectations for this show from the beginning and aren't giving it a chance.

At the moment there are 4 written reviews and all but one are HIGHLY critical and undeserved in my opinion.The casting is brilliant. Acting is right on. Writing is great. Direction is fantastic. Cinematography is top notch. Am I watching a different show? I could go on with praises of all the elements of Ray Donovan, but it would just be repetitive and monotonous, and I would run out of synonyms.I truly think Showtime has it's next hit to fill in the gap left by Dexter next season.I don't want to go into arcs, plot, etc. and spoil anything. I just wanted to make sure there was another positive review posted, so even more people give Ray Donovan a chance. Believe me, if you have liked Showtime's other amazing Originals, you'll love it as much as I do.",

For me, Aquarius is one of those series.There were things that started putting me off right away. The cinematography was slick but uninteresting. And I love 60s music, but I'm a little tired of this idea that you have to have people constantly listening to all the coolest songs from the 60s.I didn't find most of the characters interesting, including Manson. I admit, Manson is tough, in that it's possible he really was kind of uninteresting but good at talking to particularly dumb girls, but to me he seems transparent and that makes his success puzzling.For me, the only real bright spot was Grey Damon as an undercover cop. His scenes were all good, and I enjoyed the banter between Damon and Duchovny (although the rest of the time I found Duchovny flat). I think this series is well enough made that there are people who will really like it, but I felt restless within the first 10 minutes and nothing in the rest of the first episode pulled me in after that.

The voice acting is also outstanding from Bill Burr. Most people that play an angry character can make it come off quite cartoonish, yet somehow Bill Burr manages to make a cartoon come off very human by letting the anger build throughout a scene or an entire episode.

I feel that the story is more effective when you watch the episodes close together, waiting 7 days for subsequent episodes is like torture.

I love the re-vamped Dr Who, and I was a fan as a child, I grew up with Jon Pertwee as the Doctor and to me he was always the definitive incumbent, until being eclipsed by both the modern incarnations. No, Torchwood is not like Doctor Who, it's a different series; I feel that the characters are very well drawn. They are a team of typical people, they do not have the solutions to all the problems they face, they get scared, they argue, they make mistakes. As far as I see it they behave exactly how most normal people would if recruited and working in a tightly knit team under stressful conditions. There is of course the Russell Davies trademark BLG sexual behaviour, but it is portrayed in a refreshing manner and very much it keeping with the general vibe of the show.What many of the reviewers seem to miss is the fact that the show is as much about the characters as the aliens, the scripts with a couple of exceptions have been excellent, exploring human relationships and attitudes from a range of perspectives, but most importantly they have been rip-roaring entertainment.The acting is strong, Barrowman being particularly good, but they all acquit themselves well. The casting is excellent, rather than a stable of beautiful people, they have chosen actors that look, and thanks to good writing, behave, like real people. A couple of points;John Barrowman's American accent isn't fake; he lived there from the age of eight.A lot of comments regarding how derivative the series is; I suspect that Bram Stoker might consider Buffy to be more than a little derivative of his work, but none the less entertaining for it.This is an excellent series, watch more than one episode before reviewing and please try to approach it with out a particular expectation.In summary, it is brilliant entertainment.",

The casting is excellent, the attention to history in detail of costumes and culture is awesome and I rather like the fact that Marco Polo himself is more of an observer than a main character...the Mongols, especially Kublai Khan, stealing every single scene! People have bemoaned the \"stiffness\" of the actors; I can only chalk that up to very little exposure to Asian culture, film or acting! Watch some classic Asian made films and you'll see the acting in this offering is very true to form. As for casting of Chinese as Mongols when they are two very distinctly different ethnic groups,the make-up did a very credible job transforming them into believable Mongols...who are much darker in skin than Chinese, have higher cheekbones, broader faces and a more pronounced slant to the eyes than Chinese as well. The choice to have each group speak in English was a wise business decision. The biggest audience for this is Americans who don't exactly have much patience with subtitles. There was a nice combination of native languages spoken either in the background or as asides that gave one a good flavor of the languages. The attention to detail in costuming was really, really good. And for those worried about historical accuracy...there are almost 150 different editions or versions of The Travels of Marco Polo which is the travelogue \"written\" (actually spoken to a scribe) by Polo himself. They all have great flights of fantasy and magic and extremely improbable events in them so much so that some scholars have wondered if Polo had ever really been to all the places he claimed to visit, so a few inaccuracies ( like everyone speaking in English) is actually right in line with Polo's original work and actually might have been something the author himself might have appreciated. In short, stop looking for production and script flaws, stop displaying such ignorance about Asian cultures and just sit back and enjoy a darn good-adventure film!",

Like how the big supervillains are always supposed to have a secret lair, or always have to give away their big plan to Kim before they finish her off. (A favorite of mine is the villain who also works at a Costco-type super store, and instead of holding Kim above a pool of killer sharks, uses a pool of bargain-priced snapping turtles)The dialog is pretty sharp, and I think it's actually one of the more quotable television series along with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Gilmore Girls. My favorite lines? Probably how in the future, Duff Killigan declares himself \"the world's deadliest cyborg golfer\", which doesn't mean much to Ron, since \"cyborg golfer\" can't be a particularly crowded field. To those who complain about the series not being \"realistic\"- you're not getting it at all. (People are actually complaining about the careers of Kim's parents? If I have to explain why them being a rocket scientist and a brain surgeon is sheer brilliance, then you're beyond help.)

    "top_review": "Rarely do we, the television audience, experience the privilege of a show that is equal parts educational and entertaining. Not that I'm learning anything from it, mind you, but other people very well might.The simple premise is that our two hosts, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, recreate the conditions of popular myths to verify or, as is more often the case, bust them. Of course, a premise alone does not a good show make. The fun comes from watching Jamie and Adam gleefully trounce the sometimes ridiculous stories. Adam is the energetic and outgoing one, taking every opportunity to goof off and make the work look more like play, whereas Jamie reacts to things with a much drier sense of humor and is somewhat more sarcastic. I was as disappointed as anyone upon learning of the inclusion of three \"Jr. Mythbusters\" for the second season, but my concern was ill-founded, as I realized that they had just as much personality as Jamie and Adam, and my conclusion is that anyone who thinks the show has gone downhill as a result of the new additions is simply averse to any change whatsoever. The show remains a favorite.On a side note, you really have to admire how smart these guys are. Most of what they do can be traced back to physics, which makes me respect them all the more, based on my consistent inability to grasp the simplest of concepts in this particular field.",

If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then there is no point even bothering to check out this series. \"Legit\" is a show similar to Louis C.K's \"Louie\", but it's not quite the same since Louie episodes are made up with different sketches. Jim Jefferies plays himself and the story of the pilot is taken from one of his older stand-up routines where he helps his friend's disabled and dying brother get laid at a whorehouse. The dialogue and situations that occur are both funny and well acted, and it is quite moving in it's own strange way. If the rest of the episodes keep up the same quality I think it will be a hit series for us who enjoy dark comedy.",

Superb character acting, it really is. My revised rating overall is 9/10 but i'd give series two 10/10 after 5 of the 6 episodes...Well I thought I'd return for an update as I love this show so much now.. Needless to say season 2 finished as it had began.. sheer class and a great example of how good TV is right now.. Keeley Hawes we salute you.. now we are 1 ep into season 3 and Jed Mercurio has done it again the season opener quite literally blew me away I was so looking forward to it and it was like welcoming an old friend back into my life..

    "top_review": "Everything in existence undergoes a process of change; therefore, change is inevitable; one might go so far as to call change a natural law, a universal \"maxim\". Parasyte: The Maxim is a stunning new science fiction anime with a unique story and rock solid character development. The series examines themes of transformation and change - Ovid's literary masterpiece \"Metamorphoses\", after which the opening episode is named, immediately comes to mind for comparison. Parasyte: The Maxim (2014) is based on a manga series that ran from 1988 to 1995. Most of us won't realize this fact now, but bizarre science fiction focusing on alien lifeforms was quite popular in the 1980s and 90s. Great science fiction films like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), The Thing (1982), The Fly (1986) and They Live (1988) are but a few examples of films that popularized the genre. Parasyte has successfully resurrected bizarre sci-fi for a new generation, and the timing couldn't have been better. The protagonist of Parasyte is not your typical hero and the plot is far from clich\u00e9. As a caterpillar undergoes change by transforming into a butterfly, so the protagonist undergoes change by transforming into a new man; your job as the viewer is to ask questions about this transformation and find the meaning behind it - ergo, what exactly has transformed and why does it matter?The plot is believable and not outside the realm of possibility considering our limited knowledge of the universe. Like Ovid's masterpiece, the anime expertly probes the meaning of humanity; what it means to be human and what makes us human; as well as the psychological and physiological state of sentient beings. Ultimately, the series focuses on the protagonist's intellectual development or more precisely his intellectual \"evolution\". The evolutionary concept of survival of the fittest comes into direct conflict with the protagonist's views on empathy and altruism which proves problematic for decision making and creates for him a moral dilemma: should he place himself in danger in order to help others? The human part of him says yes, while another sinister part of him says no. But perhaps I've said too much.The first 5 episodes set the stage for an astonishing and action packed story that follows. The series will make your jaw drop. I've seen every episode thus far and I see nothing but a bright future for this series. If you haven't seen Parasyte, what are you waiting for? This is the best new anime of 2014. It will become immensely popular. If you watch it now you will be amongst the few who can say that you were a fan from the start. Parasyte rivals Attack on Titan and Steins; Gate. If you loved those shows, you will love Parasyte as well.A top notch science fiction anime with unlimited potential. DO NOT MISS! 10/10.",

One night, worm-like aliens called Parasytes invade Earth, taking over the brains of human hosts by entering through their ears or noses. One Parasyte attempts to crawl into Shinichi's ear while he sleeps, but fails since he is wearing headphones, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead, taking over his right hand and is named Migi. Because Shinichi was able to prevent Migi from traveling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate intellect and personality. As the duo encounter other Parasytes, they capitalize on their strange situation and gradually form a strong bond, working together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasytes, who frequently attack the pair upon realization that Shinichi's human brain is still intact. Shinichi feels compelled to fight other Parasytes, who devour humans as food, while enlisting Migi's help.",

There's also the odd fact that each episode is merely 3 minutes in length. Before cursing this cartoon, however, there are a few things to take into consideration...Most fans complained that Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones did not feature enough of the \"Clone Wars\" mentioned back in Episode IV of the original trilogy. The fans wanted more grand battle scenes. They wanted more lightsaber duels. They wanted to see more of the obscure Jedi. Star Wars: Clone Wars delivers all of these things in abundance.The art style is well-known to fans of any of the Cartoon Network series, including Samurai Jack, etc. The image of extremely stylized characters may be jarring at first to Star Wars fans who are used to only seeing their favorite characters portrayed in live-action film. This style, however, allows for very fluid animation and beautifully rendered battle scenes (on a relatively small budget!).Yes, this series is all about the action. It's not meant to be \"Episode 2.5,\" but instead a small treat for the fans to enjoy while waiting until Star Wars Episode III is released in 2005. What's more, Star Wars: Clone Wars lets fans see some brand new characters that didn't make the cut into the feature films, as well as the first-ever appearance of the main villain for Episode III: General Grievous.Anyone who complains about this cartoon is simply ungrateful and impossible to please. Myself not being a hardcore Star Wars fan, I found that Star Wars: Clone Wars actually got me more excited about the Star Wars series in general. I would recommend the micro-series to any fan of action and science fiction.",

    "top_review": "The self-defeating world of MTV began as a spark in the mind of one perceptive demographics adviser or another, but soon it grew to epidemic proportions, numbing and sugarcoating all things rebellious in a depressingly successful attempt to convince the masses that nonconformity is all about styles and fads. Any sensible teenager will tell you that it is an unwitting mockery of the things it believes it is making available to an already converted audience, but amongst the throngs of bright colors and loud-but-not-too-loud noises that essentially is MTV, you will occasionally find a gem; an intelligent, insightful, informed show of independent thought, sincerity and sardonic subtlety. \"Daria\" is one such example.Anybody who used to watch \"Beavis and Butthead\" (no comment) will recognize Daria already, as the plain girl with glasses and the monotone voice that would often foil the titular duo's moronic and half-baked plans. When the show began to think about packing it in, MTV approached the creators with the offer of giving Daria her own show. And thank heavens for that. Not only is \"Daria\" up there with \"Frasier\" as one of the greatest spin-offs of all time, but it threatens to take a place as one of the greatest stand-alone shows of all time.Daria Morgendorffer, our bland anti-heroine, is not your average teenage girl. Smart, sarcastic, opinionated but highly unmotivated, her life revolves around observing the actions of others with her best friend Jane Lane, a misfit artist from a family of unconventional thinkers. Together Daria and Jane see fit to mock the sea of stereotypes that is their suburban hometown of Lawndale, mainly the student body of their high school. Daria's deep loathing of all things superficial is regularly tested by the presence of her shallow and materialistic sister Quinn, while her workaholic lawyer mother Helen and her perpetually stressed out and slightly unbalanced father Jake struggle to do the right thing by their daughters in the interactive jumble that is life in Lawndale.At a mere glance, one might perceive \"Daria\" as a children's show, due to its animation. However, even the slightest exertion of further examination would reveal that it is no more a children's show than \"The Angry Beavers\" is a sophisticated portrayal of American Wildlife. Where a lot of shows sell their credibility for cheap laughs and mold their characters on popularity polls, \"Daria\" is firm in its subtlety, never wavering in its belief that, given time, its audience will get the joke. Some may take longer than others, but all that do never turn back.The genius of the show lies in its ironic reflection of a culture that would never allow a show like this to get off the ground. Surrounded on all sides by the trivial and materialistic values she lives to hate, Daria takes refuge in the companionship of Jane, the isolated safety of her own room and the glow of the television (which will probably be tuned in to dissocial ironathon news program 'Sick Sad World'), emerging now and again for a futile attempt to significantly impact the alienating world around her. And perhaps the experience might be alienating to us, the audience, if it weren't for the shows strategic and successful ploy to get us to see the world through Daria's eyes. Once there, we're completely hooked, and all the rest of the show's intrinsic jokes fall into place.Arguably the most enviable quality of animation is its freedom to let characters be exaggerated without being unrealistic. The most brilliant thing about this is that eventually, characters that are truly only meant to serve as tired clich\u00e9s perversely become beloved, unique personalities. Trent, Jane's lazy soft spoken musician brother with delusions of future stardom with his garage band Mystik Spiral, Kevin and Brittany, quarterback of the football team and head of the cheerleaders respectively, two blissfully ignorant airhead lovers with no aspirations beyond their current high school status, Mr. O'Neal, the hypersensitive English teacher, balanced in the extreme by the borderline psychopathic Mr. DeMartino, an irate History teacher who has lost the will to educate. Even the unbearably shallow and conceited Fashion Club, four fashion-victimized teenage girls who believe their undeservedly elitist circle is doing the world around them a world of good, gradually grow on you until, like it or not, you couldn't imagine Lawndale without them.It is because of this paradoxical attachment to the characters that serious plot developments towards the end of the series are able to engage the audience on a level that is more than just honesty for the sake of mockery. Once we've grown accustomed to Daria's detached and cynical attitude, the show begins to admit that perhaps it has been having us on a little bit, at least concerning the rigid personalities of our beloved caricature personas. Therefore, once Daria has opened up a smidgeon , so does her/our view of her world, in an event suspiciously symptomatic of personal growth. And from there it's a small step to actually caring about the students, teachers and residents of Lawndale as we farewell them in the \"Daria\" movie finale \"Is It College Yet?\", in which we see our little high-schoolers graduate and move on. It says a lot about the show that it is able to gradually soften its bite enough to let us feel for the characters without ever feeling inconsistent.If one were to only catch a few episodes of \"Daria\", then they might like what they see, and they'd be well justified. But they'd ultimately be missing out. Because as entertaining as the self-contained half-hour segments of the show can be, the world of Daria is not about separate jokes, separate characters, separate stories or separate anything. Everything within the show works to build to a greater understanding about teenage life, indeed about life in general, and everything it entails; a simple masterpiece that's value only increases when put into social context.",

Conan is the guy who earned the spot that he truly wanted ever since he saw Johnny's show as a kid by doing 16 years of truly influential, groundbreaking and critically applauded comedy. The level of quality and quantity of material that Conan turned out every night on Late Night was truly outstanding and in the opinion of this reviewer has not been matched by many other comedy shows and certainly not any other talk show host in history. Conan's gratitude and adulation when he finally received his dream job did not go unheard and he specifically thanked Jay Leno on no more than three significant situations: On his Late Night farewell, as a guest on Jay Leno's last show and on his first Tonight Show.In extreme contrast, when Jay Leno unashamedly began his return to the 11.30 slot, just like in 1992, Leno had absolutely no words, positive or otherwise, to say about the person who had just left the chair. Instead Jay Leno continued doing the very same easily digestible, hardly strenuous material he had been doing for 18 years. Anyone who had any hope that Leno might evolve to somehow warrant his un-relinquishing need to hang on to the show has been proved wrong by his March 1st premiere.After a typical monologue(making almost no mention of Jay's premiere) spliced randomly with unfunny new sight-gag 'segments' like \"The World's Tightest Pants\" Jay did a taped piece involving him looking for a new desk. This was the cue for another unfunny segment where C list celebrities like Randy Jackson and Adam Corolla invaded people's homes while Jay sat at their various desks. That was the limit of the punchline. Jay then revealed his desk as if it was some momentous occasion and interviewed a hyper Jamie Foxx whose attempts to get the crowd to cheer along Leno were humorously futile.

I like \"Mortal Kombat\" for what it is, martial arts fighting without the need to implement a deeper understanding for the reason behind it.However, I will say that this \"Legacy\" series is impressive. Especially compared to the older movies and the earlier \"Conquest\" series. Why? Well simply put because of the production value behind it. It outshines the previous stuff by a mile and a half. There is just a heavier and better feel to this series, it is more in the spirit of \"Mortal Kombat\", if you will.I like how it takes each character and gives you some background behind who they are and what drives them. It is all done in a relatively short period of time in each episode, so of course it is limited just how much background story you get about each character. But so far it has been great entertainment and added some nice details to the characters portrayed so far.As for the acting, well I have been content with the people they have cast for the various roles. People have been doing great jobs bringing the characters alive and believable on the screen. My personal favorites are Scorpion and Sub-Zero, always have and always will be.I find \"Legacy\" to be a well worthy addition to the \"Mortal Kombat\" universe, and it is well worth watching just for the production value behind the series alone. It is really, really great.I sort of gave up on this franchise as a plausible rendering on the screen after the \"Conquest\" series, so it was just by sheer random luck that I came across \"Legacy\", and it was just out of boredom that I sat down to watch it. But after the first episode, I just kept going watching it all, it was just that good. So perhaps \"Mortal Kombat\" can have a glorious comeback on the screen and justify itself after some questionable previous movies and an even less so series. I am excited to find out...",

    "critic_rating": "8.0", 
    "top_review": "WKRP is the show that I may have the toughest time reviewing.  I would like to make my love for this show clear without simply stating it was the best show of all time, but there may be no other way.  I Love Lucy, MASH, Cheers, Seinfeld, Mary Tyler Moore, and any other sitcom regarded as classic all pale in comparison to WKRP in Cincinnati.  This show focused on eight characters, rarely devoting too much time to any one individual.  The cast did not change in four years.  They didn't even add anybody for a few episodes to play a love interest or something like that. They didn't have to.  Each one of the eight could have carried the show by themselves. I was born during WKRP's initial run and I have grown up in an era where almost every sitcom is populated by characters whose personality is exaggerated beyond reality, and who can't seem to laugh at anything that doesn't involve sex.  KRP had its share of these types of jokes, but they never dominated the show.  There were rarely any episodes trying to figure out who's dating whom.  There was never a season ending cliffhanger wondering which two characters were going to get together.  In fact, the episodes where this did happen are some of the show's weakest such as Andy's country western girlfriend, and the episode where Johnny stays at Bailey's apartment prompting rumors around the office.  That being said, there is not one single episode of WKRP in Cincinnati that isn't funny.  Even the two I referenced earlier have their moments.The character development and subtlety of this show is unmatched.  Each character built a relationship with the other seven, and the writers were able to tap into those relationships whenever it was needed.  There are episodes that you have to watch several times to get the full effect of what is going on.  The union episode is one of the best because of the way Andy deals with the other characters, but this is something that goes unnoticed unless you pay attention to all the little details that you can see watching the episode a second time.  Everything down to his wardrobe is just perfectly crafted.  Another great KRP moment comes when station critic Norris Breeze refers to Jennifer as a \"total airhead\" in front of Mama Carlson.  The one person Mrs. Carlson considers her equal, and she is called a \"total airhead.\"  What a great moment.The final episode ties everything together perfectly. It was not guaranteed at that time whether KRP was returning, so they made an episode that could be the last, but it didn't have to be.  Johnny's explanation of how KRP is supposed to lose money explains why Mrs. Carlson went along with the new format in the first place four years earlier.There has certainly never been a more socially consious sitcom, and there are many great dramas that didn't deal with as many issues as WKRP.  Every political issue that is important even today is tackled in a KRP episode. Abortion, racism, homosexuality, censorship, unions, alcoholism, drug abuse, and education to name a few.  There are also episodes involving the rich vs. poor, and a classic involving lying, scheming politicians.  I have literally tried to think of an issue that wasn't addressed on WKRP, and I can't do it.It's unfortunate that none of the eight actors ever made a real splash after WKRP.  Tim Reid, Howard Hesseman, and Loni Anderson have had their moments, but none of these actors are considered to be big stars.  For four great years, they created a show that a lot of people missed.  For those of us who have gotten to see it, we will never forget.",

Give me a break. Supernatural was INSPIRED by the Hellblazer comics (it's in the Supernatural Wiki). i.e., Constantine came first. Saying \"we don't need another Supernatural\" couldn't be more wrong. Supernatural has lost the plot, and is no where near as good as it was before. This brings an entirely new, fresh viewing of demons and angels and possessions. So far I absolutely love it and I really hope they stick true to the comics. I hope they won't rule out the chain-smoking just to calm viewers down. On a network that shows the Hannibal series, I sincerely doubt that chain-smoking is the thing to worry about when it comes to bad habits. I loved the actual comic art they showed at the end of the first episode too. I can't wait to see where this series is going and I REALLY hope it continues. This series has what Supernatural has lost; a dark, gritty ambiance that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a DC fan.",

I had been anticipating this show ever since the commercials came out and I was satisfied. The idea of the show is somewhat original, the one-whole-game-per-show keeps the show moving, and at the end of the season, a game with all the winners will probably be played. This show may seem like a waste of time, but it is fun to watch at night before going to bed. Watch this rather than that other game show after it, as that show is absolutely horrible and boring.",

I have read a lot about the supposed falsehoods that Bear Grylls is perpetrating & have read comments about many people who have criticized the show.I would like to add my own two pence of opinion here...accepted that he has a camera crew & other people running behind him, but I think the main purpose of this show is to show us how to survive...somebody has written that he puts himself into situations that nobody who actually gets lost would ever do (like climbing down a waterfall, getting soaked in ice cold water etc)...again the assumption here is that IF anybody encounters such a situation, this is how they could save their life...I have read allegations that he sleeps in motels and not in the shelters that he has himself built...clearly the filming of an episode takes several days, so why on earth would he subject himself to the inconvenience of sleeping out all that time??? hasn't he demonstrated the most effective way to build a shelter and isn't that more than enough for a person who is watching the show to learn a few tricks? There is another complaint that he never is in any real danger...in fact being the show's star attraction, he would be fool hardy if he put his life in danger and it makes sense that he takes all precautions...again he is showing us the ropes so why don't people understand that? I commend the fact that he is prudent enough to value his own life (for the sake of his producers, fans, his family & obviously himself)...As for the comparisons with survivorman, I have not seen the other show...from what I have heard that show is quite informative, though not as entertaining...I feel both of them are doing a good job in their own unique ways...it would be unfair to compare them...Bear Grylls might be making a lot of money with this show, but so what? I don't feel there is anything wrong with using your skills & abilities to earn money...don't we all try to do exactly the same??? The purpose of this show is to provide information about basic survival in various extreme environments in an entertaining manner...I think, on that score, it delivers perfectly...this is evident by the fact that my 10 year old nephew can watch this show in rapt fascination as does my 60 year old father-in-law...Lastly for all those who criticize the show, though I respect their opinion, I feel they are being too harsh & overlooking the obvious purpose of the show...this is not a test of endurance for Bear grylls and he is not trying to prove anything (check out his background, he has achieved more than most of us will in 10 lifetimes)...he is merely showing ways of survival in a very entertaining manner & let us not be so naive as to think that this could be achieved without a certain amount of manipulation...sit back & enjoy the ride, guys...",

    "top_review": "Cowboy Bebop is a truly post-modern show. Not in the tired \"Scream\" sense of self-awareness, but in its willingness to mix genres and blur boundaries. At the most basic level it's a Space Western. But Bebop is not content to be merely that, so there are added dashes of film noir, gothic horror, creature-feature, black comedy, screwball comedy, spy action, crime, romance, tragedy, action, philosophy, science, spirituality, fatalism, optimism, buddy-buddy stories, slapstick humour, parody-- just about every type of tale under the sun appears in some shape or form during Bebop's run. It's a show where each episode really is different from the last. Were it not for the recurring characters, it would be hard to believe that the brightly-coloured blaxploitation parody \"Mushroom Samba\" could possibly come from the same series as the bleakly violent \"Real Folk Blues\".The world that the series inhabits is distinctly post-modern, too; space ships fly through hyperspace gates, but once on the ground their pilots fight with twentieth-century handguns. Scenic bays would look for all the world like they were taken from modern-day Japan were they not dwarfed by Jupiter, the enormous gas giant looming in the sky like some enormous benevolent god.And the music - tribal drums and chants give way to electronic pulses that give way to jazz sax and trumpets that give way to rock guitars that give way to blues harmonicas... composer Yoko Kanno faultlessly turns her hand to an eclectc selection of genres and instruments, ably backed up by her band, \"Seatbelts\".All of which sounds terribly impressive, but why on Earth should you watch it? Because, buddy, it's one of the finest television shows ever made.I have to admit I'm not a big anime fan. Most anime that makes it over here seems to be either about schoolgirls with supernatural powers who battle evil, or adolescent boys who - for some convoluted reason - wind up having to pilot big giant robots. And whilst I'm assured that shows such as Escaflowne (schoolgirls and magic) and Evangelion (boys and robots) are actually rather good, they completely fail to get my blood pumping. Enter Bebop. Ultra cool Spike, grumpy strategist Jet, trigger-happy Faye, nutball Ed and intelligent dog Ein are as far away from the usual brats and bots anime as you can possibly get. Their motivation, too, is far from the usual anime fare. These guys aren't bounty hunters because they want to fight crime and keep the peace - all they want is a wad of cash, and bounty hunting seems like the best place to make big money fast. Although they will do the right thing when pressed, they rarely forget their true motivation - and if they do, their perpetual lack of food will soon remind them. Life isn't easy, and when you're a bounty hunter it's even harder.Not that the crew of the spaceship Bebop are one-note characters. As the series progresses, our initial assumptions about the characters are overturned. At first Spike appears to be the cliched laid-back slacker (who just happens to be a mean jeet-kun-do fighter), but we then learn of his fall from the criminal underworld and of a loss that killed him emotionally. Jet's the obvious gruff authority figure, until we realise that he actually cares for the crew of the Bebop as if they were his kids (and seems to have dabbled in pot and psychadelic drugs when he was a teenager). Faye's the usual feisty stand-offish female lead but only because her amazingly tragic past makes her push away friends for fear that she'll become attached to them. Ed's just some nutty kid until we meet her crazy father and realise that it could well be her deprived childhood that sent her over the edge. And Ein? Well sometimes it's hard being a super intelligent Welsh Corgi on a ship where nobody appreciates you, you know?But not every episode is deathly serious - the character development is mixed in perfectly with humour (both light and dark), fistfights, shoot-outs, car chases, aerial fights, space battles and some of the lushest animation you'll see in an animated TV series. And all of this spread over only 26 episodes.Yes, many people espouse the old \"leave 'em wanting more\" line, but so few of them actually do it; Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the perfect example of a series that spends three or four years being top-notch TV then freefalls due to apparent apathy from both the cast and writers. Bebop avoids this by wrapping every dangling plot thread up in just one season of television. And after the final jaw-dropping episode it's quite clear that the series is most definitely over.Never before or since have I seen a series of such astonishing variety, intelligence and style. Ten out of ten.",

    "critic_rating": "8.4", 
    "top_review": "One Britain's great science fiction comedies, \"Red Dwarf\" is one of the United Kingdom's finest television exports.  This is due to the fact that alot of the comedy, through the characters, satirizes British stereotypes (slobs, snobs, neurotics) and makes its own commentary on the bleakness and absurdity that is human life.The format, which has become considerably more flexible in recent years, started thus.  Set in space, some two or hundred years or so in the future, on an enormous mining ship called Red Dwarf, working class slob Dave Lister (Craig Charles) finds himself placed \"in stasis\"(frozen in time) as punishment for illegally hoarding a cat on board the ship.  Awakened by the ship's senile computer Holly (Norman Lovett), Lister is shocked to discover he's been in stasis for three million years and the rest of the crew have been killed by a freak accident.Asides from the now-senile computer, Lister's only company is a vain, narcissistic lifeform who evolved from his cat (Danny John-Jules) and a hologram of Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie), his bossy and officious superior.This was the set up for the first two series of Red Dwarf.  The format changed in series three when Holly swapped sexes and became Hattie Hayridge, and the crew recruited Kryten (Robert Llewllyn), an eager-to-please mechanoid with an overactive guilt chip.  In series six, Red Dwarf and its computer were abandoned, and the crew were forced to survive in modified shuttlecraft Starbug.Chris Barrie left as Rimmer in series seven and was replaced, courtesy of an alternate universe storyline, by Kochanski (Chloe Annett), the love of Lister's life.  The ship, complete with resurrected crew, returned for series eight and saw the adventurers, along with a back-from-the-dead Rimmer, thrown in the ship's brig for their adventures in the previous series.In the first two series with a minimum main cast, the much-despised grey sets lent an appropriately barren, lonely backdrop to the very character based comedy.  Most of this consisted of intimate comic banter between Lister and Rimmer, occasionally livened up by the Cat's hilariously self-obsessed prescence or an off-the-cuff joke from the laconic Holly.Seasons three to five broadened the scope of the series, making it more experimental with different science fiction concepts.  The added prescence of Kryten helped this, his 'groinal socket', susceptibility to the whims of a sometimes deranged Rimmer and increased attempts to break his restrictive programming brought new comic dimensions to the series.Series six and seven reverse the comedy-science fiction ratio of the series in that the former now takes a back seat to the latter.  In other words the comedy of the series accentuates the main science fiction based plots. The comedy emphasis was restored for series eight, although, much like series seven, this element was alot weaker than before.The series benefitted from alot of strong characterisation.  Craig Charles embodies carefree slob Lister, while Chris Barrie turns in a wonderfully uptight performance as the hopelessly neurotic Rimmer.  Dancer Danny John Jules brings alot of colourful charm to the Cat, while Norman Lovett is wonderfully sardonic as Holly, whose almost apathetic stupidity allows for alot of comic misunderstandings.  After being replaced by Hattie Hayridge for a few seasons, Lovett returned in series seven.Robert Llewellyn, his entire head covered in a prosthetic mask, has some fine moments in a character that is very much a comic take on the android \"Data\" from \"Star Trek:TNG\".  Chloe Annett is wonderfully superficial as Kochanski, but is attractive enough to make plausible Lister's attraction to her.Series eight was helped considerably by the return of Mac MacDonald as Red Dwarf's hapless Captain.  During the two-part episode \"Pete\" he is subjected to a series of increasingly hilarious indignations, prompting a wonderfully humiliated performance from MacDonald.Time will tell whether or not the series will return, but the series remains one of the definitive comic staples of British television.",

    "top_review": "Disney has been making some radical changes in recent years. Back in the day Disney was always known for its films and amusement parks, its original creator driven content always seemed to take a backseat. For years the only decent original Disney channel series were Fillmore! and The Weekenders. However like I said recently Disney has been taking a bold new direction. The addition of Disney XD has led to the creation of some great shows Phineas and Ferb and particularly Chris Prynoski's new show Motor City. Their current original content mirroring the 90's shows that put creator driven series on the map. Their latest play in this new direction the creation of what so far promises to be perhaps their best creator driven series yet Gravity Falls.Emerging from the ashes of the Marvellous Misadventures of Flapjack (another quality show, however not Disneys) where series creator Alex Hirsch served as writer and storyboard artist, Gravity Falls is perhaps the best instalment in a series of programs crafted by current Cal Arts Alumni since Adventure Time. From a cartooning and animation standpoint the series feels refreshing. The character designs feel like some superb mixture of The Simpsons, Classic Disney animation with a bit of The Marvellous Misadventures of Flapjack thrown in. The Characters are drawn in a very fun way and they lend themselves to the quality character animation the series has produced. From a character animation standpoint the work is spirited. It is fluid and comedic exemplifying how much the character animation can be integral to the characters themselves. Cartooning and Animation aside though I feel the true greatness of the show stems from its writing style, approach of comedy and characters. Alex Hirsch and his writing team have made a show that conjures to mind the character driven humour of the classic Simpsons with the weird and often creepy nature of a 90's kid show called Eerie Indiana. The end result is a show with unique and weird story lines and a level of humour that does what many of the 90's shows did best, transcend its target audience. This show produces jokes that will work for both kids and adults. The characters are also very likable. We have seen characters like Dipper, Mabel and Grunkle Stan before but on Gravity Falls they are crafted so believably that we can forgive that. These are not just funny characters, they are characters with defined personas, they are oddly relatable and they have even in these 9 episodes shown some semblance of character development something that is usually left out of many North American animated series. So far this is a near perfect show its only misstep so far the episode entitled Dipper Vs. Manliness, which I won't spoil it for you, has a great concept but is too much build up and not enough pay off. For me this is a show that makes the kid in me smile. Watching this now is like tuning into my childhood favourites (Hey Arnold, Ren and Stimpy, Courage the Cowardly Dog) only now I am old enough to appreciate it.",

Well directed and written, gorgeously shot and edited\u0085 From the opening sequence, you know you are watching something very special. Sense8 has the human element that Matrix lacked. It reminds me of The X-Files, but better. It is fantasy and science fiction, but not far-fetched. Not even for a single moment. It feels alive, real and very, very exciting and suspenseful.Andy and Lana Wachowski go around the world to bring you this beauty... From the streets of Nairobi to the alleys of San Francisco through the smoggy Mexico City and the snowy mountains of Iceland, this show brings it all\u0085 and it is DEEP! The series brings elements of drama, suspense, comedy and action and differently from other Wackowski's movies; it brings characters we can relate. Every single one of them is incredibly well constructed and the cast performance is superb. It is impossible to watch this show without deeply connecting with those people. I cheered, I cried, I laughed, I bit all my nails and I feel in love with Kala, Riley, Lito, Nomi, Capheus, Wolfgang, Will and Sun. I adore those characters and at the end of the season, they were like my own family. This, my friends, is great cinema. Nothing else! \u0085and it deserves much more! I can't wait for season two.",

Each individual is from a different culture and part of the world. In the aftermath of a tragic death they all experience through what they perceive as dreams or visions, they suddenly find themselves growing mentally and emotionally connected. While trying to figure how and why this connection happened and what it means, a mysterious man named Jonas tries to help the eight. Meanwhile, another stranger called Whispers attempts to hunt them down, using the same sensate power to gain full access to a sensate's mind (thoughts/sight) after looking into their eyes. Each episode reflects the views of the characters interacting with each other while delving deeper into their backgrounds and what sets them apart and brings them together with the others.",

They couldn't be more wrong.Yes, the show has some swears. And yes, there is nudity. But how is that worth a 1-star review? Are you 10 years old? This is a program created by and for Showcase, a network that shamelessly brands itself as \"television without borders,\" so there should be an expectation of some level of debauchery. How many other top shows out there contain the same material? Look at True Blood, Game of Thrones, Californication, and the list goes on. House of Lies is an adult show with adult themes. Get the hell over it! This show is clearly not for you. Everyone's welcome to their own opinion but I doubt anyone will find yours to be useful here. Don't give it a 1-star review just because you don't approve of its content. Go watch \"The Wind at My Back\" or something like that instead.That being said, Don Cheadle is fantastic as the lead part in this comedy. He pulls it off so well that it's unexpected and refreshing. Cheadle's \"psycho\" ex-wife is also a great character, flipping between pill-popping party girl and smart, driven career woman that we love to laugh with even though we hate her for being such a b*tch. I can't wait to see more of this show and I applaud everyone involved for a job well done. The acting is convincing and the writing is sharp. There is a great dynamic between all the characters, especially that of Cheadle and his father. The only acting that's less-than stellar comes from Cheadle's son's character, but it's difficult to find a convincing child actor anywhere. He'll probably improve as the show goes on. I was laughing throughout the episode. Don't let the review of some prude turn you away from this great comedy.",

    "top_review": "What can I say, except that those were the days! They really don't make it like this anymore-wholesome, scripted comedy, that people of all ages can appreciate.I have been watching this show since I was around 7 years old, and in my experience, it has only gotten better with age. As a youngster, I think I enjoyed it because of the character of Balki-the naive sheepherder from a small developing island, faced with a massive culture shock when he arrives unexpectedly at the door of his distant cousin, Larry. I laughed along as Balki was dazzled by Western technology, taught Larry his bizarre Myposian rituals, made endless failed attempts at popular American sayings, and had his good nature taken advantage of time and time again. I must admit that at the time, Larry was just a character that was around so Balki could exist, and I really took little notice of him. But now that I am older, it is Balki that has begun to fade into the background. The character of Larry seems kind of straightforward-an average guy in his mid 20s who, despite himself, comes to learn many life lessons from his eccentric cousin. I would have thought they could have gotten any old actor to play someone like that, but now I see that I was wrong. Mark Linn Baker is subtly brilliant as Larry Appleton. He portrays Larry's neurotic, on-edge personality, without becoming tacky and predictable in his mannerisms. And despite being \"the normal one\", his use of physical comedy is hilarious. The 2 lead actors bounce off each other perfectly, and make this show work.This show is pure fun, but also made a nice statement about morality, which made you care about the 2 lead characters. At the age of 20, I still shed a tear when Balki moves back to Mypos and he and Larry have to say goodbye. And when Jennifer accepts Larry's unrehearsed marriage proposal, over the proposal her new attractive, wealthy boyfriend. And I still laugh when I see Larry and Balki sneaking into Jennifer and Maryanne's apartment at night to swap Jennifer's engagement ring, fix up a house and accidentally get stuck in a chandelier, or dancing to the reworded limbo rock as they attempt to bake 3,000 \"Bippy Bobkas\".As a disclaimer, I must warn that this show isn't exactly high-brow, to say the least. The story lines are often far from believable, the dialogue isn't always as funny as the raucous canned laughter would have you believe, and a \"straight guy meets wacky guy\" comedy isn't exactly cutting edge. But in all honesty-so what? This show may not be the height of intellectual viewing, but when you're just looking for a show to veg out in front of and forget your troubles for half an hour, then look no further. This show always leaves you with a smile on your face, and is a refreshing change from the myriad of recycled reality shows they beam to us at every opportunity.Since this show was cancelled, a lot of shows have come and gone that I have loved for various reasons, but I have yet to find another sitcom that can hold the flame to this one. I prey that they will release this series on DVD. And if not, then I hope the reruns I recorded back in the 90s will last long enough for me to show to my children.",

    "critic_rating": "6.9", 
    "top_review": "The greatest thing about \"Crossing Jordan\" is that it never, for even one moment, ceases to make us care about its characters. It seamlessly gives us a mix of tragedy and comedy, as well as humanity and warmth, which is no mean feat, considering the profession all of the main characters have.With the abundance of shows cropping up in the last few years with a theme of \"investigation\", the profession of Medical Examiner has been thrust into the limelight of the public's eye that it never has been before. One needs to look no further than the ratings of all of the \"CSI\" shows to find proof; the minutiae and drudgery of police and forensic work, once thought to be bland, boring and completely without entertainment value, now has viewers glued to their sets.But \"Crossing Jordan\" is much more than that. While I applaud shows like \"CSI\", and to a small extent, \"Law & Order\" for their ingenious writing and convincing story lines, none of those shows has ever really developed its characters to an extent where we care more about them than about the details of whatever case they happen to be working on at the time. \"Crossing Jordan\" has developed it's characters very, very well. Consider:The main character, Jordan Cavanaugh (Jill Hennessy): when the show first started, we knew her to be a mouthy, bitchy, seat-of-the-pants, lives-by-her-own-rules kind of girl, who would always be in trouble but somehow, always gets to the truth. And while the appeal of such a character is undeniable, such a routine would have gotten old really fast, as well as the \"haunted-by-her-mother's-as-yet-unsolved-murder\" story line. I understand that early on, we knew that this is what drove Jordan to be the person she was, but it felt like that particular story line was used as a crutch to hold the series up. I think her character is now sufficiently developed to get past it now. She's still mouthy, and still lives by her own rules, but not as often as before. She's truly grown up.Dr. Garret Macy (Miguel Ferrer): Originally played up as the crotchety, curmudgeonly boss, who walked around with the \"how-in-hell-did-I-end-up-in-this-line-of-work\" look on his face. Despite his somewhat abrasive character, there's no doubt that he possesses a tremendous inner warmth to go with his incredible intelligence. It's those rare occasions when he shows his softer side that make for some of the series' best moments.Lily Lebowski (Kathryn Hahn): In the beginning, she seemed like a fragile dandelion of a person, nursing a not-too-subtle crush on Dr. Macy. I was afraid that her character would never expand beyond two dimensions, but she has become the moral center of the show.My two favorite sidekicks, Nigel and Bug (Steve Valentine and Ravi Kapoor): it was these two that kept me coming back, week after week, during this show's growing pains. The tall, lanky Brit and the diminutive entomologist from Bangladesh are without a doubt the best on-screen duo in prime-time. One smiling and ebullient, one moody and sullen, they play off of each other so well... I can't aptly describe it in words.Det. Woody Hoyt (Jerry O'Connell): Though his character hasn't really developed much, beyond the on-again, off-again relationship he seems to have with Jordan, it's nice to see him get more and more screen time now.Several other characters have come and gone: Jordan's father (Ken Howard) and M.E.'s Trey Sanders (M. Ali), Peter Winslow (Ivan Sergei), Elaine Duchamps (Lorraine Toussaint), and Dr. Devan Mcguire (Jennifer Finnigan), have all contributed during their brief stints on the show.Every single character has experienced tragedy and loss, in various degrees, all while helping total strangers deal with their loss, and that has made them all bond together into a very tightly-knit group... almost a family, if you will. It is a family that I wish I could be a part of... and that is the TRUE yardstick of a great show.Always fresh, never dull. I hope that \"Crossing Jordan\" will continue to draw the audience it deserves.",

Jordan is still feisty and mercurial and a pain in the butt, but management tolerates her because she is good at her job.

It goes: \"You be the killer, and I'll be the victim and we'll figure out how this happened.\" The driving force in Jordan's life and career is the crime she took the longest time to solve -- her mother's murder.",

Well, aside from SpongeBob which I hated at first but actually liked once I got a job at a Toy Store.Either way, this show had so many great moments. It was ALWAYS entertaining and until Nick decided to go all \"Extreme\" and start canceling the good shows and putting nothing but pureed s**t on the air, I would watch this every Saturday Night during \"Snick\". Is \"Snick\" even still on? Not that it matters. I'm 23 now and I still get a kick out of Kenan and Kel.The convenience store owner (Who also starred in Head of the Class in 1986-1991) was one of the best characters. Always having problems.Kenan's sisters crush on Kel was perfect.Kel's love of Orange Soda and his tendency to always piss Kenan's Dad off in every episode was perfect.Kenan's schemes were golden. And at the end when he would come up with another plan and tell Kel to grab \"A Tricycle, a Bowling Ball and a tube of glue and meet me at the Resivoir.\" or stuff like that I would always crack up.Now. The Amanda Show. God that is horrible. Sometimes I wish they would cancel Nickelodeon. If only you could cancel a TV Network. It had a good run. Now it's time to pack up and leave.Same with the Disney Channel. It was good until it became all Extreme and hip. And when they added commercials.",

Maybe I am biased because its my favorite show. Or maybe because I spent my childhood watching it, and for me, this show encompasses so many memories of the 80's, along with Cyndi Lauper, Garbage Pail Kids and Jelly shoes. But, actually, even though I am biased in a sense, I could still be right. I have never seen another sit-com that has had me on the edge of my seat, so awaiting the next episode. I have been lucky enough to see Who's the Boss on cable recently to refresh my mind, and it is only better now that I am old enough to appreciate the relationship between Tony and Angela. I can also appreciate the characters more in-depth, and I can analyze why Tony and Angela are the way they are, why it is so hard for them to admit their love to each other, and I can finally appreciate it when they DO declare their love for each other... If you are a romantic, you'll love this show! It has sweetness, laughter, romance, goofiness and much much more. There are a lot of very good sit-coms that can offer one or a few of the aspects that Who's the Boss offers, but only WTB has it all. To top it off, the acting of mostly everyone on the show is excellent, especially Judith Light and Tony Danza. If you love to watch great couples and you're sick of the sappy soap operas (which were only good when Judith Light was on OLTL, LOL:-) then you have to give WTB a chance. You'll get hooked.

    "top_review": "I used to love \"The Rugrats\".  Before they became unbearably popular. Before Dil came.  Before David Doyle died.  Before the movies.  Before . .. you get the picture.Why?  Very simple.  The initial Rugrats was a great show.When the show premiered, in 1991, with \"Tommy's First Birthday\", nobody could've guess how far it would go.  It had a simple premise: what life as a baby was like.As the show began to climb, the jokes and the show itself began to become polished.  The animation was horrid - but who cares?  If the show's enjoyable, then I won't hate it for a single quality.  Besides, the scribbles that made up the animation added to the whimisical feel of the show.The show was, at first, intellegent, with jokes and plotlines that both kids and adults could relate to.  Media references abounded.  For example, in \"Showdown at Teeter-Totter Gulch\", a Stetson-wearing Tommy faces off against the \"Junkfood Kid\" (played by Nancy Cartwright), recalling \"High Noon\" and numerous Leone westerns.  In \"The Booster Shot\", Chucky's doctor is named \"Dr. Lecter\", a reference to the flesh-eating psychiatrist from \"The Silence of the Lambs\".  The episode with Dean (Angelica's love interest) spoofs James Dean in \"Rebel Without A Cause\".  \"The Dog Groomer\" recalls \"The Terminator\", \"The Mysterious Mr. Fiend\" spoofs \"Frankenstein\", Dr. Lipschitz (Tony Jay) is a Sigmund Freud-esque child psychologist, and numerous others are similarly intellegent.Also, the characters were well-developed and likeable.  At this point, the dialogue was great.  Not only the kids, but the adults.  The adults were intellegent, had emotions, and were very realisitc.  They made many of the jokes, and were interesting, rather than the no-dimensional shells they become.The show's popularity began to grow in 1992, but it ended abruptly in 1994, when Paul Germaine left the show.(Continued in Part Two.)",

I was amazed that a TV production was permitted to adapt a biblical story to commercial television and not make it a travesty. The writing, acting and casting are first rate and the ingenious production that sets the story in a modern setting easily identifiable to not only American but World audiences is outstanding. How power corrupts and becomes the guiding principle of a regime (whether its elected or hereditary) and how human failings overshadow all the events they contrive and no matter what they orchestrate, realize that they are really never in control.Ian McShane steals the show as the King and is perfectly cast. The writers have even managed to depict the proper tone of a man falling from the pinnacle knowing that his path is taking him to ultimate failure after he's abandoned his principles.Kudos to Christopher Egan and Allison Miller. Egan as the 'David' and reluctant hero and Allison as the love interest and King's daughter who wants to be more than just another pretty face.Th writing is first rate and I'm amazed that it survived the usual story development process as well as it did.It's a do not miss and will be talked about for years.",

One part Bond, one part Indiana Jones, one part western, and one part sci-fi, it was also one of the most fun shows. It had the right combination of cast, characters, comedy, action, and adventure. And unlike the shows that would try it later (HERCULES, XENA, and others), BRISCO knew how to make its contemporary stylings work. The show never took itself too seriously. Billy Drago was a great villain as John Bly, a character that appeared in a story arc running through the season. Whenever Brisco wasn't busy tracking Bly, he was busy searching for one of Bly's gang or some other bad guy. It was also interesting to see the buddy cop concept (one white, one black) in a western setting. Bruce Campbell and Julius Carry had great chemistry. The interplay between them was often hilarious. I also liked how Brisco and Bowler weren't friends at first, but rather were more like competitors, and only after several episodes of crossing paths and being forced to work together did they learn to like one another and partner up. Of course, Kelly Rutherford was hot as Brisco's on-again/off-again love interest, saloon singer Dixie Cousins. Many episodes featured some nice father/son moments as Brisco found himself talking with the ghost of his legendary bounty hunter/father, well-played by Lee Ermy. Those scenes, while sometimes brief, were always a nice addition. It's tame violence and family-friendly stories helped make it an audience favorite and develop a following that continues to this day, but Fox ultimately decided to pay attention to THE X-FILES instead, and they canceled BRISCO after just one season, despite it's big audience and decent ratings. But I'm glad the show was then and not now, as it would have been canceled after just the third episode to make way for some lame drama or comedy.

When a product is BS, he knows it and tells them he's out. But sometimes, he further demeans them in a way which is almost painful to watch. Same with Daymond sometimes. Kevin O' Leary is truly the worst. He keeps making awful analogies about how his money is his soldiers and other stupid stuff like that. This is a terrific show, however the arrogance of the sharks is sometimes over the top and becomes annoying to watch. 7/10",

    "top_review": "That era of Miami Beach is a fantastic treasure trove of visuals and stories of all kinds of incredible characters. I grew up in it a few years closer to those years than Mitch Glazer, so maybe I just remember it better. Hey, he got the series made, whereas I've just had this stuff in my head for 50 years, so I'll definitely give him some credit for portraying the atmosphere. Unfortunately though, he's just objectively inaccurate on a number of points where he really didn't need to be. Those are probably things that only a nitpicker like me would care about, but, to me and other Miami Beach people of the era, those things might matter. The worst part, though, is just that the characters and the story are boring, just the opposite of the reality.So, I watched episodes 1 & 2 and then chucked it after the beginning of episode 3 which showed the girls at the 1959 beauty pageant dancing The Twist. Unfortunately, no one danced The Twist until mid-1960 when Hank Ballard's original version came out, and then it really became big with the Chubby Checker #1 version later in 1960. I spent a whole lot of time working on picking up tourist girls in teen dances in those hotels, and I screwed up my back twisting too much at one hotel bar mitzvah and had to miss a day of school. Also, my father had the first rock and roll club on The Beach, so maybe I'm a bit sensitive about the music stuff. That's another thing- they talk about \"Miami\" in Magic City. Sorry, but people said \"Miami Beach\", not Miami. I'm serious, because Miami was this place across the water somewhere in the South of the US. It was another universe that people only visited for sports events. Miami Beach was its own world, and New York was really the next stop in those years before freeway exits. No big thing, but it just irked me, as did a bunch of things in the earlier episodes. In episode 1, the restaurant in the hotel can't function pre-New Years 1958-59 because all of the Cuban kitchen staff are preoccupied with the events in Havana. Sorry, but the staff would definitely have been black, not Cuban, as hardly any Cubans had come across yet. I remember in 1958 when the first Cuban came into our school wearing a white suit, and I became his first friend. I used to go over to his house, one of the last houses still on the beach, and they had all kinds of weapons and adults arguing in Spanish. Although no one will ever know, his father, Eladio del Valle, was most likely key in the Kennedy assassination. He was found in his car with a bullet in his head on the same day as David Ferrie was found dead in New Orleans.The owner's son, Stevie, has a build that only comes from weight-room workouts, and weight rooms didn't exist then. The only gyms then were places that boxers worked out, like the 5th Street Gym where I'd go to watch Cassius Clay. When my father took me to the spa at the Fontainebleau, there was no place to work out. The guys got a rubdown while getting their nails done with clear polish. The closest thing to exercise was walking into the steam room. No one in those pre-steroid, pre-workout days, except for a few very odd muscle guys, had developed lats or triceps. Even pro football players didn't use weights, as they thought that it would make you \"musclebound\". The owner's wife talks about \"stress\". Not a concept yet. The Eames Management chairs in his office weren't commercially available yet. More importantly, Frank Sinatra opened cold, no warm-up act or big build-up! I remember sneaking into the Boom Boom Room to see Sinatra, and it just wasn't like that. Actually, when someone asks me where I grew up, I still often say, \"The Boom Boom Room\".In episode 2, the guy orders \"extra-lean corned beef\"!! Heresy! Now, maybe Glazer was just intending that to be some kind of joke, as the guy ordering wasn't Jewish? However, I don't think that anyone ordered extra-lean anything in those days, and especially not corned beef. Then they make a big thing about the daughter's bas mitzvah, and she says, \"Everybody I know has her bas mitzvah!\" Absolutely wrong. Not in 1959. I doubt if one Jewish girl in a hundred had a bas mitzvah. Then, grandpa tells the daughter that he'll take her on the rides at Fun Fair. Sorry, no rides at Fun Fair other than the mechanical horsie for 3-year-olds. A somewhat less nitpicky thing is that the big mob guys didn't live in big mansions! Meyer Lansky and \"Trigger Mike\" Copolla, the Italian boss at the time, both lived in modest homes without gates. As I remember, Copolla's did have bullet-proof glass in the living room that faced the street right across from our junior high school, but it was just a normal 50's house. Miami Beach definitely had big fancy houses and cars, but the mob guys kept a low profile, although everyone knew who they were. My \"fraternity\", Knights, had the sons of the of some of those mob guys. The dads were nice enough to me, though they did things worse than anything shown in Magic City. My friends died early.Well, enough of my kvetching for now. Maybe I will watch the rest of the season, just because it's playing in my head whether I watch it or not.",

By day the hotel at the center of 'Magic City' is all diving clown acts and cha-cha lessons by the pool, but at night Miami Beach reveals a darker truth.

CharlieSheen was all right, but at this point the show was unbearable towatch because of Locklear's wooden acting abilities and the waythe other cast members (which had dwindled to just four, countingthe Mayor) were shown only once or twice per show.  If Locklear had not been brought in and the other cast membershad remained with the show, this show could have survived evenwithout Fox. This show went off the air in 2002.

I have no intention of giving each season or episode a number evaluation as I feel the entire body of the show is whats important. Well thought out story arcs were the norm in this amazingly diverse world inhabited by the most fleshed out characters on any TV show. A perfect example of this is the character Wesley who started as the comedic sidekick and slowly, over the seasons, transformed into a certifiable bad-ass without ever coming across as forced. Angel never treated the view like an idiot, never wrapped everything up in a nice little package after every show only to forget about the previous events in the next episode. Angel also never got stale, in part because it was cancelled in its prime by the WB for no solid reason as it was one of the highest rated shows on the network. Every season seemed to get a little better with the fifth, and final, season being the best, in my humble opinion. The show has become like an old friend to me which I can visit from time to time to remember what TV should strive to be like and to see an example of great story telling. In a time when TV is turning into a wasteland of trends and shows that do nothing but recycle, Angel was a bright spot which has sadly gone out. Buy the DVDs and let the show live forever as most of what else is on TV is already dead.",

Because of its unique shooting style, magnificent writers, and terrific actors, it is the best show I ever watched. Other cop shows are no comparison. In fact, no other drama on network television had such a racially diverse cast. This is the only drama I have seen with African-American actors in leading roles. It is a sad fact that there aren't other shows like it out now.This show truly did duck the \"system\" of other dramas, staying true to the source and portraying realistic characters. Anguish, joy, anger, humiliation, and respect are evident in the faces of the characters in assorted episodes. The first few seasons were the best, in my opinion, but the other seasons were still better than anything else on the networks. I shudder to think that \"Nash Bridges\" beat this amazing show in the ratings. If you are at all interested, try to find this show on television in your area.

His 8-year-old brother Riley isn't of equal intelligence but what he lacks in that area he makes up for in attitude. Both young boys, the revolutionary-in-training Huey and the hip-hop-loving, hustler-in-training Riley, are moved from the big city to the 'burbs to live with their grandfather, and chaos ensues.This is \"The Boondocks\" - \"remote location; far from civilization\" (IMDb trivia). There's also a fine cast that includes Regina King, Gary Anthony Williams, and John Witherspoon voicing the main characters.Created by Aaron Mcgruder in 1997 while a student majoring in political science at the University of Maryland, his comic strip \"The Boondocks\" is revolutionary on all fronts and takes no prisoners. It's already stirred up a sh*tstorm for its fiery political rhetoric, pervasive language, sexual content, and frequent and unrepentant use of the N-word... and I love it! I'm absolutely, positively hooked!This is what I've been waiting for as far as animation with an urban twist. It's way over the top in terms of animation, which is pseudo-Anime'-style, and doesn't forsake entertainment or message for political-correctness. No wonder it only comes on late at night. (Arrggh) I haven't been able to find too many black-themed comic strips or books that take a hard look at life in the black community without resorting to stereotypes without irony. Its two main characters Huey and Riley are presented in a way reminiscent of \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" the ghetto youths taken out of their world and placed in land foreign to them and have to adjust. \"The Boondocks\" is all of that.I really can't see how anyone can't like \"The Boondocks.\" I'm 20, a young black male, and my mother saw two minutes of it the other night and her jaw hit the floor. It was yanked from circulation due to its attacks against the Iraq war, George W. Bush and his administration, and McGruder has been completely unapologetic. I know, and viewers should know a reaction like that shows you're watching something special. I won't dissect McGruder's views, which he funnels through his characters, but they are inflammatory and make me want to watch more, just to see what he's really trying to say.I won't comment on the controversy, other than I'll say that many have already missed the point, and \"The Boondocks\" has only been on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim for a month. People are afraid of stuff like this for reasons completely unknown to me. They take one look at it and decry what they see, making big scenes in magazines, newspapers, and television. What they're missing is a brilliant expose of the problems of the black community. Yeah, it's over the top; that's because it's satire! It is supposed to be ridiculous because black people use the N-word frequently, glorify guns, violence and the gangsta life, condone the degradation of women, smoke weed a lot, listen to blaring rap music, and experience genuine \"N***a moments.\"It's funny in the same way we've laughed at comedians like Dave Chappelle, Richard Pryor, Eddie Griffin, Eddie Murphy, and Chris Rock in the past. Wake up! Maybe our community can take a cue from \"The Boondocks\" and take steps to improve our culture in the eyes of the rest of the world. Welcome to \"The Boondocks.\"",

John Ritter showed that he was a master of physical comedy and it really showed on this show. Another thing that really helped to make this show great was the whole ensemble. I feel that Joyce DeWitt was totally underrated in her role as the sensible Janet and that she was the perfect counterpoint to Jack's leering personality. The only thing I was disappointed with was how they devolved Suzanne Somer's character, Chrissy. If you look closely at many of the early episodes, Chrissy wasn't quite the dumb blond that she later turned out to be. If anything she was more naive then dumb. Other than that, this show will always be a classic of the era it was produced in.",

    "top_review": "Network: NBC; Genre: Drama/Comedy; Content Rating: TV-PG (for language, drug use and adult content); Available: on DVD; Perspective: Modern Classic (star range: 1 - 5); Season Reviewed: Completed Series (1 season)There are few shows, currently on the air or in the entire pantheon of television, that are so obviously crafted with as much love as 'Freaks and Geeks'. Created by Paul Feig and produced by Judd Apatow, 'Freaks' crackles with an honest writing and flawless chemistry and creates it's own wonderful universe. To watch the show is to be awash in details and obvious care that was taken to make it.The high school series has never been so real. 'Freaks' follows a group of geeks and a group of burnouts at McKinley High School in 1980, both of which centering around the Weir siblings. Lindsay Weir (Linda Cardellini) is our heroine whose rebellion from the Mathlete life and into the world of the burn-outs (with the terrific James Franco, Jason Segel, Seth Rogen & Busy Philipps) creates a domino effect that the entire series spins on. Sam Weir (John Francis Daley) is an underdeveloped geek whose unrequited love of cheerleader Cindy Sanders (Natasha Melnick, perfectly cast) drives much of the geek story lines. Sam faces the torment and humiliation of daily life in high school with friends Neil and Bill (wildly underrated, star-making Samm Levine and Martin Starr, respectively). The show is a badge of honor for all involved. The school is populated with a fully realized universe of supporting characters from Lindsey's church-going friend Millie to Dungeon master Harris to Mr. Rosso (David \"Gruber\" Alan, hilariously stealing any scenery not bolted down) - the school guidance counselor without any boundary for the inappropriate. . No more accurate depiction of the look and feel of high school (or the hell that was high school depending on your perspective) TV has ever seen. Becky Ann Baker and Joe Flaherty make the perfect '50s era parents. Flaherty comes off the most over-the-top, but even that fits the vision. The dinner table scenes between the Weir family are so uncharacteristically happy and intentionally corny that it will surely be off-putting to the average cynical viewer. Years before \"The Office\" made embarrassment and viewer discomfort into a science, \"Freaks and Geeks\" was doing a similar thing, effectively making us really feel Sam and Lindsey's embarrassment over their parent's behavior. I particularly like the set design of the Weir house, and the show in general. \"Freaks\" is set in 1980 but designed with 50s, 60s and 70s paraphernalia. Unlike the many fast food period pieces now, - \"That 70s Show\", \"The Wedding Singer\", \"American Dreams\" - where the decade is treated like a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, the decade doesn't turn over to 1980 and suddenly everyone runs out and buys parachute pants and the Thriller album. The self-professed anti-'Dawson's Creek', the series is almost as distinctive for what it isn't than for what it is. It isn't a flashy show with 20-something preps playing high school kids set to blaring Top 40 pop songs where the biggest problems among the characters include juggling two hot dates on the same night. In other shows - most overly concerned with what the consuming public thinks of them, the geeks and the burnouts are fringe groups usually given as much thought as the potted plant in the corner, or used as 1-joke stereotypes. 'Freaks and Geeks' is the first show to acknowledge that they may be more interesting. They don't participate in the high school caste system and they muse about never being able to get girls. I love the way the show's camera lingers on faces and soaks up Cardellini's incredible expressions. It rests on the kids as they sit and talk about their favorite drummer or the TV show they watched last night just like everyone does. At an hour the show allows for those quite moments. Just as it takes time out to do elaborate mid-show set pieces like an action movie-like dodge ball sequence or a violent spat between Kim Kelly (Philips) and her parents. The series is packed with these unforgettable little moments - heart-breaking and screaming funny, sometimes all at once. In 18 episodes it says more than most shows ever do: the geeks watching their first porno, the freaks getting their first fake IDs, the family catastrophes in Niel and Bill's homes and the painfully real crush Sam has on Cindy. Their world doesn't always a happy ending and awkwardness and embarrassment rule the day. The fact that 'Freaks and Geeks' wasn't given a chance to make it by NBC is a sad testament to how network executives box in their viewers to find a ratings silver bullet. No matter, these 18 episodes are self-containing and fully satisfying enough to get over the sting of the network apathy. I'll break a rule and do a little necessary promotion here. All this is captured in a DVD set this show deserves, with as much attention and love put into the extras (29 commentary tracks!) that was put into the show. It is the single best DVD I've ever seen. Who knows if the show would have been able to keep it up as the kids grew up and the show had to be written around it. As it stands, this is like lightening captured in a bottle. That perfect mix of all the elements coming together to make a truly classic series. No matter what the future holds, \"Freaks\" has a reserved place in my heart. This is really one for the ages, people. No list of modern classics is complete without \"Freaks and Geeks\". * * * * * / 5",

I think she was the primary reason I kept watching Newsroom for three seasons. I kept waiting for her every appearance. In Grace and Frankie, Tomlin and Fonda have to overcome a rather unbelievable situation--that is to face the fact that they husbands they have been married to for over forty years have somehow falling in love and intend to marry each other. Relegated to a kind of \"Odd Couple\" status, they end up living in a Malibu beach house their husbands bought years earlier. Each couple used the house on separate weekends. Now Grace and Frankie have to pick up the shattered pieces of their lives and move on. Jane Fonda as Grace is at her brittle comedic best. She delivers in spades, looks stunning in her latish 70s and plays off Lily Tomlin's hippy-esque character with spunk and funny nerve. Grace has to face the fact that she's an uptight, judgmental pain in the ass. And Tomlin's Frankie is just the person to remind her over and over again. The scripts are tightly funny. The interplay between the two ex-couples is expert. Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen have nearly thankless roles as the two spouses who dump their wives, but they handle the dialog ad the romantic banter with dignity. But let's face it, you're waiting for Grace and Frankie to spark off each other. It's not the kind of laugh-out-loud absurdest insults The Golden Girls hurled at each other with such glee, but the humor is key here. There is is just enough drama to remind us of the absurdity of life. I couldn't wait to watch this show when it was announced. Fonda and Tomlin were terrific with Dolly Parton in Nine to Five, but they are even better here. This is a terrific show. I'll stick around as long as these two glorious stars are here to make us laugh and cry.",

However, the very dark elements succeed in intensifying the storyline, and in character building. All the characters are very unique, no cookie-cutter fill-ins here!, and the bad guys are especially well developed. This is a far cry from Skeletor and Cobra which were the villains of my youth (and oops, I've just dated myself).

This show wants you interested right from the start but there's no tricks or flashy style, just good solid drama. The acting is superb, especially from the 2 moms, it was nearly like watching a documentary of a family in action. I also remember thinking the music the show used was particularly appropriate and very complimentary to the visuals.As the title implies, The Fosters is a show about a foster family but with a nice modern day twist - there are two moms instead of a mom and dad, the eldest son is the biological son of one of the moms from a previous marriage, and then there are the twins, a boy & girl, recently adopted by the family. This is a show concerned about all the people who fall outside of the traditional family existence, about the children who need another family to take them in. And they make it interesting! Really can't emphasize this enough, there was obviously a great effort employed to combine the serious and complex issues with the need to entertain to tell the story, and they did brilliantly, i wasn't bored for a second.I have to thank the reviewer who summarized The Fosters as \"filth\", i may not have ever watched it but after reading his/her review i felt it my public duty to actively counteract this act of douchebaggery by watching the show and then actually saying something objective somewhere in my review. I was so glad to see that 0 out of 12 people found his review useful (lol) but because this poorly-disguised rant against homosexuality was the featured user review, and also because there were only 2 reviews at time of writing, i felt it would be useful to be number 3 to let you guys know you won't be wasting your time with this one :)I really can't think where they fell down, apart from a small complaint that 'who was who' was a little hard to follow at times, even though that by the end you know who is who.

    "top_review": "I am a former FBI Agent; I went through the FBI Academy, and even have written a nonfiction book about my experience (\"Eyes Pried Open: Rookie FBI Agent\"). I am also a frequent TV watcher, although my tastes definitely gravitate towards the more edgy cable offerings than the big network shows (that quite frankly are usually somewhat \"dumbed down\" to be appropriate for the masses). Due to my former profession, I felt compelled to watch this show, although I assumed I would be completely disappointed and would find flaws throughout.Well, the pilot exceeded my expectations. No, the depiction of the Academy is not perfect, but some of the scenes were eerily similar to what I experienced. While most viewers would assume that surely the romances and flings in the show are purely silly fantasy fluff, I can assure you that those types of behaviors did occur at the FBI Academy (infrequently, yes, and with much more average looking people, yes). Funny enough, my biggest gripe was how \"nice\" the instructors are in the show; I cannot begin to imagine what would have happened if someone was talking on a cell phone at the firing range. FBI Academy instructors in reality are incredibly tough; I still have scars on my knuckles to prove it (but they are some of the best and most dedicated individuals on the planet). But minor gripes aside, the feeling of being back in college in a dorm but with the structure (physically and mentally) of boot camp is what it was really like.Sure, the storyline is far-fetched, but this is a fictional TV show. It is not the next Homeland; I do not expect it to clean house at the next Emmy Awards show. But for what it is, it is well done, and feels like the show writers at least had enough input to keep the story in line with the \"real\" side of the FBI.In summary, this is an admirable effort, especially for a major network; the pilot gets a nice 8 out of 10 from me. If the show goes downhill (which is definitely possible; it seems like one of those shows that might be best as a one-season-only run), I will update my review accordingly. But for now, I will continue to be entertained for an hour each week with the escapism that the show offers.*** UPDATE ***It saddens me to have to update the review, but I feel it is my responsibility to do so since I have elected to stop watching the show. Bottom line, it feels like this was written by somebody who is paid by the plot twist, and at some point it cheapens the show to not being watchable. Also, I have to agree with another commenter who felt like the show must be a Shonda Rhimes production (nothing against her, but the show looks and feels much more like Grey's Anatomy than Homeland). I finally had to stop watching because of the gross inaccuracies about the lives of the NATs at the FBI Academy. The show still has entertaining moments, but with so many great shows out there, I am having to pull the plug on this one to make room for others. I suspect that will be the fate of this show; it started strong and has a full season 1 order, but I would be surprised if it made through a 2nd season. But then again, Grey's Anatomy is still on ...",

    "top_review": "As momma always said,... when you tell the truth you can always repeat the same story since you don't have to remember any of the lies you may have otherwise told. In Shades of Blue you have an entire team of a police division involved in police corruption. The two lead characters on this corrupt police team are Harlee Santos played by super star Jennifer Lopez. Harlee plays a veteran cop who is also a single mom raising her 16 year old daughter. Her daughter Cristina Santos (played by Sarah Jeffery) who is a cellist prodigy requires a substantial financial contribution to enrol in a private school for music prodigies. This is the main reason that mom and police woman Harlee Santos is part of a corrupt team of police officers. The team leader is Detective Matt Wozniak, played superbly by the legendary crime genre star Ray Liotta. Ray Liotta is one of my guaranteed good performance actors. Just think of the starring role he had in the crime films Goodfellas, Identity, Cop Land and/or Narc which were all good performances by Ray.With only the first episode televised at the time of my review it is a tad bit early to tell how the main characters roles will evolve, and if the television series writers will lean more in developing the main characters in the direction of a television crime series like The Shield, or more in mind with the strategic crime series and multiple Emmy winning series The Wire.I will say though the director of the pilot series is the seasoned director and producer Barry Levinson who has ensured we understand that Harlee Santos is a very busy cop and mom. Within the first 60 minutes in no particular order, we witness Harlee run down and handcuff single handedly a very quick and agile street thug, set up an alibi for a rookie cop who kills a low life drug dealer without thinking first, deliberately smash her daughters car up to back up an alibi she created (remember what momma said about lies versus telling the truth?) earlier with Detective Matt Wozniak, gets caught by the FBI trying to take a bribe form a bookie (who is an FBI agent) and Harlee still finds time to work out in a boxing gym both in and out of the ring with her boy toy (no surprise here) trainer boyfriend. Whewww, Harlee accomplished all that in less than 60 minutes.So now we see we have a team of corrupt cops trying to do their job of protecting the good citizens of New York City and at the same time make a few bucks off the backs of the bad guys by skimming a little kick back in protection money. We have the FBI closing in on this team of corrupt cops who are now under surveillance, and we have the corrupt team leader Matt Wozniak trying to figure out who the snitch is in his own unit before the FBI can close in on them all and break up this happy little family of close knit corrupt cops.There is a lot going on in Shades Of Blue and I remain optimistic with this stellar cast of Grade 1 movie and television stars such as Jennifer Lopez, Ray Liotta, Drea de Matteo (The Sopranos), Warren Kole and Lolita Davidovich the series will have a strong first season performance. Mrs Shullivan and I were impressed with the pilot episode. So far I will give the series a positive 9 out of 10 rating for the stellar cast, and the excellent directing and cinematography of the series pilot.",

    "top_review": "I am from England and I just so happen to be visiting some friends in the USA where this show has just come out and is presently on episode 4.I have just watched all four episodes and came to IMDb to see what people have to say about it. I am really surprised that the reviews are so negative by so many people!This show will do really well in Britain (that's England, Scotland and Wales - the UK includes Northern Ireland too) because British drama is often gritty, solemn, and very very dark. And so is this show.No one in 'The Leftovers' is happy. Everyone is mourning the loss of their loved ones in the aftermath of a a global event in which 2% of the world's population inexplicably disappeared. They are also dealing with the pain caused by the subsequent suffering of people around them, and its consequences.This show has top notch acting by all concerned and is driven by the development of the characters, and the unfolding of events that now follow the rapture.Nothing is explained in the beginning and the viewer is supposed to attempt to piece together what is going to unfold as the season goes on and the events slowly start to make sense to us.It seems to me that here in the US, many people do not like thinking when watching the television. That might sound harsh, but it is truly beyond me how a show like this can get so many poor reviews when a show like 'Teen Wolf' (which I also saw for the first time a few days ago) is praised to the hilt. The episode of 'Teen Wolf' I watched cut between 4 separate scenes like a Latin American soap opera that consisted of a guy pointing a gun at two Mexicans who were trying to get him to say some words out loud, and a lacrosse game with an angry werewolf and some very shocking acting.'The Leftovers', on the other hand, is fantastic captivating storytelling; rather than a show whose purpose is to dumb down a nation, it requires people to use their brains and think about the darker side of the reality we actually live in today.As a side note, the British actor Christopher Eccleston loves this kind of material. Check out the original British version of 'Cracker' or 'The Second Coming' (in which he plays the return of the son of God) to see what I mean. British cinema is no different. Christopher Eccleston stars in both 'Shallow Grave' and 'Jude' - two excellent dark and depressing films that show the depths of human suffering that the values of society perpetuate.In episode 3 of 'The Leftovers', his character the priest attempts to save his church with an idea that seems to come from supernatural inspiration. The underlying question in the episode is whether or not he is on a path of good or evil in the way he chooses to do so.'The Leftovers' is intelligent and it is thought-provoking. The writing is excellent, and the quality of this show, to my mind, is indisputable.Nevertheless, I don't think that the content of this show is for everyone. Episode 3 in particular was so sinister that it was tough viewing. And not everyone wants to deliberately delve into a world of misery once a week. Just don't watch something like 'Teen Wolf' instead!",

It throws great humor with huge action and you cant beat it. I started Dragonball by reading the manga when I was younger and still love them and the show is just as good if not better! Sure, some stuff form the manga has been taken out of the show but thats because some of that is more mature(nudity) then would be for the audience.All in all, Dragonball is one show you need to see in it entirety to feel its greatness. I recommend it to everyone because its that good and every age can enjoy it. From the silly monkey boy to the perverted Turtle Hermit, its all out fun.10-10",

A living dead zombie who assists the police in finding bad guys after eating the brains of victims is inherently ridiculous and, consequently, tongue in cheek (or perhaps in brain).

Whether the show can develop new scenarios to maintain the interest of viewers or just repeat the same themes with minor twists remains to be seen. I have to say, though, that the pilot was very promising, largely due to the enchanting performance of Rose McIver in the lead role.

    "top_review": "I have watched all 9 episodes so far and can't get enough. I became intrigued with the concept while watching a Laura Linney interview on The Daily Show. It's often funny, sometimes hilarious, often sad, and sometimes downright heartwrenching. The characters are quirky, conflicted, don't know how to express their feelings, and are frequently nasty, self-involved, and make mistakes, while also being caring, noble, and giving, just like real people. The show takes a sensitive and difficult subject that is usually not discussed, and deals with it using a large dose of humor and the occasional portion of pathos.Laura Linney's character has spent her life doing what everyone else has expected her to do, and hasn't a clue who she wants to be. She decides to try and figure that out before it's too late. I understand her desire to keep her disease a secret so that she gets to live as much as possible before she dies. She could \"buy\" the attention and understanding of her husband, son, brother, and others she cares about if she tells them about the cancer. However, then she would not only be surrounded by sadness and despair for her remaining days, she'd be suffocated and everyone would assume the cancer is the cause of her behavior when in reality it is merely the catalyst.I watch a lot of shows that I like, and many that make me laugh; but few touch me as this show has. Sometimes the image in the mirror isn't the prettiest person in all the land, but this is about learning to be comfortable with - even love - what we see. To do that, we first have to see the true image, not the one we think we should see or the one we wish we saw.",

Because it's something new and believe me i have watched too many TV shows to be easily impressed by a new one, since its almost always the same \"stuff\" BUT..Awake - did it, it impressed me. I'm highly grateful to those producers that gave this show it's awesomeness...I see that many people do like this show and rated 10, in my opinion: that's exactly what this show deserves!So if you are searching for a TV show where there is drama, mysteriousness, crime, awesomeness and at last but not the vary least NEW? This is a show you've got to see, don't take my word for it and see for your self ;)Best regards Jusup",

I think it's funny, lighthearted and I like the characters. I think the actors play the character's well and deliver the lines as naturally as they can considering it's a sitcom and all sitcom character's tend to be kind of overly emphasized.",

Then they ruin it with clich\u00e9 and lazy story telling. To make a good series you can't use plot links from movies, such as the bad guys being in total control and the good guys making all the mistakes as it gets boring very quickly. Although suspension of disbelief is a given in science fiction, not when it comes to the behaviour of characters, as it just makes them seem exceedingly stupid and the viewer will stop empathising. The first couple of times I gave the benefit of the doubt as this series had such potential, but then I just got frustrated and irritated by the crap script... It makes me wonder whether those managing such a project simply think the viewer is as stupid as the characters they present us with... underestimating the viewer will only lead to failure... a damn shame!",

The show hits the gate hard as a veteran executive producer of a late night comedy show (Judd Hirsch) goes on a verbal assault on live television, a moment straight out of Network (which the news media quickly catches onto). The studio is in complete disarray only minutes after the show ends, especially since the network's new president (Amanda Peet) as only been on the job for one day. How can they repair the damage done? Why not call in the two men who made the show a hit (Matthew Perry and Bradley Whitford), and have since been fired two years prior. But things aren't going to be so easy to fix since there are execs just waiting to shred all three of them to pieces.The show is pure Aaron Sorkin: it's witty, intelligent, and heart-felt about issues. It's also a blast to watch as a cast of incredibly talented actors and actresses work together to make Sorkin's words shine. But one thing Studio 60 isn't is a retread of either Sports Night or The West Wing. It's a completely different monster. This time, Sorkin's looking to dive deep into the worlds of Hollywood, Mass Media, and Big Business. With Perry and Whitford, we have televisions new odd couple, both incredibly funny both alone and together. Peet brings her A-game with her as she takes on her most ambitious part yet. And let's not forget some great contributions by D.L. Hughley, Timothy Busfield and Steven Webber. And this is coming straight from the pilot. Who knows where the show will go from here.

A series that makes you glad to be alive; a series that breaks your heart that you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode.  Shameless is such a series.The Gallagher family consists of dad Frank and his six children (their mum apparently abandoned them years ago).  Frank spends most of his time out drinking, only returning to the family's council house on a run-down Manchester estate when he's dragged home comatose by the police in the early hours of the morning.  The result is that the six kids more or less bring themselves up, with the eldest - 20-year-old Fiona - acting as the token mum.From all this, it should make for depressing viewing.  But the beauty of Paul Abbott's semi-autobiographical drama is that it's not even remotely depressing.  The six Gallagher kids, their friends and neighbours form an extended family where everyone loves and supports everyone else; and the result is bawdy, rude, but above all uplifting, heartwarming and fun.  The performances are uniformly excellent and to single anyone out would be unfair.  The first episode does a wonderful job of introducing the large cast of characters - not just in a cursory way either, but in sufficient depth to make you care about this assortment of misfits enough to want to tune in next week to see what befalls them next.This is what TV should be.

The said cartoon series was one of the highest-rated TV shows at the time. I was especially obsessed with Rogue. She's beautiful and sexy. She of superior strength and when she fights, she rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yet she can't be touched. She's an irresistible temptation to men, especially to Gambit who longs to touch her so much, when she can't be touched.I was a sappy romantic at heart too so I'm always looking forward to moments between her and Gambit!!! And the people at my school were no different. Different people - different X-Men character favorites and obsessions, collection of X-Men comics and lots of talk about it during breaks, you name it. Even people over 25 watch it. It is little wonder, however, why there was all this fuss about X-Men. The characters' looks and personalities are charismatic and appealing to viewers. They are drawn as sexy and beautiful women and the men as beautiful and sexy as their female counterparts. Each has their own individual history and personalities which viewers simply find lovable and appealing. The plots and stories are exciting and interesting and there's no denying that the MUSIC at the beginning of every episode is REALLY CATCHY!!!!!!!!!!!!! The animated series was simply VERY WELL DONE!!! The fact that this animated series is one of the highest-rated and most-viewed Saturday morning programs in American history to date, that it is very popular in other countries aside from the U.S., and that it boosts sales of X-Men comics--as people who who didn't read x-men comics before this one started reading them as soon as they got obsessed with it--- are proofs that this is definitely one of the best cartoon series in 90s. In my opinion it is the BEST CARTOON SERIES, not just during the 90s but UNTIL NOW!!!!!! X-Men shows a different idea of heroes. This is unlike Batman and Superman who are loved by ordinary people because they are heroes. X-Men, on the other hand, although fighting for peace and justice, defending their fellow mutants and ordinary men from harm in the process, are hated and feared by those they've sworn to protect. Humankind, that is. Still they continue to protect and defend mankind.Marvel really did it right with this one and it could NOT be said that Batman and/or Superman animated series is/are superior than this one. X-Men The Animated Series(90s) is undeniably one of the most excellent, most watched and ultra-popular cartoon series up to this day!!!!!!!!",

Now on to the show!If you saw the three movies, which I have, you'll already know that this show is spot on with the movies. Same cast, same tone, everything you liked about the movies is there. It's supposed to be cheesy the concept is a library with mythical objects, Flynn is a complete nerd with 20 something degrees, he was a shut in. If you want a damn uninteresting monotone action star who thinks he's acting go watch the hundreds of Crime investigation on the air.

    "critic_rating": "8.3", 
    "top_review": "The nostalgia critic is a 20 year old comedic reviewer who reviews movies from his childhood. All of the movies he reviews are movies from the 80s and 90s. Most of the movies he reviews are considered bad movies, such as Batman And Robin, Super Mario Bros and so forth. He reviews his movies while making fun of completely stupid points of the movie or plot holes. One could argue that the nostalgia critic is more of a comedian then he is a movie critic. Either way, he's hilarious to watch.His humor consist of making tons of pop culture references and going over the top in his acting like a Looney Toons character. He's an extremely passionate movie lover who has fun all the way in his entertaining acting. Those who love movies will love seeing the Nostalgia Critic lampoon horrible films of the past. On average, each review is approximately 20 minutes long, and walks through the movie explaining what happens so you get the grasp of the movie along with his jokes. He has a number of episodes called \"old Vs new\" which he compares an old movie with a recent remake. For example, he compared the Old King Kong with the new Peter Jackson King Kong. He also has \"top 11\" videos, which is when he ranks shows or movies in a certain category. He made a video listing \"top 11 scariest nostalgia moments\", \"top 11 nostalgia shows\", \"top 11 saddest nostalgia moments\" and more.The nostalgia critic is played by Doug Walker, who you can tell really admires and loves movies. Not only is he funny, but he also has a passion for analyzing what's good about movies and what's bad. This is shown in his Top 11 videos, Old Vs New and none nostalgia critic videos that are posted on the site (ThatGuyWithTheGlasses.com). What makes the nostalgia critic very recomendable is how he explores childhood movies. The closer your age is to him, the more you will recognize the movies and shows he reviews. This is especially true when he makes tributes to nostalgic TV shows. It's a nice way to revisit your childhood, hence his title, \"nostalgia\". We all have movies that we love due the the nostalgic value it created when we watched it as a child. You'd think that the nostalgia critic would crush those memories as he rips apart movies he reviews, but trust me when I say it isn't so. Seeing the nostalgia critic tear apart your childhood films should only make you love the film even more, because you would spend 20 minutes looking at the film as an adult, defining an even bigger line of what's a childhood treasure.",

    "top_review": "Are You Being Served is a fantastic example of British humor at its finest. Granted, with almost 30 years since the telecast of the first episode, some of the humor has become dated.  However, the cast and script-writers took the concept of double entendre to a whole new level with the jokes in the show (the best one I think being about Mrs. Slocum's cat, if you get my drift!).  The thing that makes the show stand the test of time is that they did not have to resort to outright obscenity and crudity to get the humor across.  It requires a little bit of thought to follow some of the jokes, which while base, are veiled in \"false propriety\".  It is something that I would have no problem letting my children watch because they would not get the  jokes until they were old enough to understand and deal with the humor. What comedy today can we say the same about? The show also has the ability to pull you in, make you privy to the \"secret jokes\" and make you feel part of the club.  You become bound up in the inside jokes and personalities, and can identify with the characters (within reason: who can understand the concept of Mrs. Slocum's changing hair-colors?!).  Overall, it is a great series and well worth watching, even 27 years later!",

Eliza Doolittle has become Eliza Dooley, and Henry is an obvious reference to Henry Higgins!To be honest this connection wasn't necessary if you check the first 2 episodes of \"Selfie\". It could have worked with any names since the actual premise is completely different.The 2 stars are Karen Gillan who is very photogenic and pleasant to watch and John Cho who after the first 2 episodes has proved himself as very suitable for the part.The series it is basically a satire of the social media and the modern way (young) people communicate. Tweeter, facebook, are constantly mentioned and can be seen in screens in most of the scenes. Loose sex attitude, casual relations, the addiction of the social media themselves are a prominent theme of the show.It's not hilariously funny, despite some strong off-beat humor, but will make you smile to say the least.The work place is an ...advertising company (again?? gimme a break!! isn't any other business out there for a new series) and that is the only thing that actual bothered me. Well that, and the fact that Eliza is presented like a total ho!Overall: Good intentions, a very cute leading lady. Check it out.",

    "top_review": "** May contain mild spoilers **'Hemlock Grove' is a rare and strange beast among the many current fantasy/horror shows on TV. This new series is refreshingly original; although vampirism and werewolves haven't exactly been underrepresented in movies and TV-shows over the last couple of years, 'Hemlock Grove' manages to find a very interesting new approach and uses old European myths and legends - and even a bit of Sci-Fi - to inject some fresh blood into a genre that started to feel a bit stale. The mix is strangely compelling \u0096 and highly addictive.The cast is very strong, especially the two leads Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd and Landon Liboiron \u0096 and of course, the always great Famke Janssen. The production values are also worth mentioning: the music, the cinematography and the set-designs in this show are absolutely beautiful, the gory make-up effects look realistic and CGI is thankfully kept to a minimum. I'm a bit surprised this show hasn't found a bigger audience yet, given how well it is produced (and this wasn't exactly a cheap affair either: season 2 had a budget of 52 million dollars for 10 episodes), but maybe it's just a bit too original for that. As far as I'm concerned, 'Hemlock Grove' certainly deserves to be seen; offering unique 'Horror' with a fantastic, slightly surreal atmosphere and amazing images, this highly original series is a prime candidate for binge-watching. 8 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

Every day I would flip through channels and if I saw this show was on, nothing else mattered. I would pick watching an episode of this for the fifth time than a Hey Arnold for the first time (although I did enjoy that show too).I think what I liked this one the most out of the 90's shows was because it was somewhat on its own. Other shows always showed the kids at school with two parents and good grades. This one was slightly more realistic in that sense. Sure, they played the sports ridiculously well so i'm not saying that was realistic, but Twister had a mean brother, Reggie and Otto didn't have a mother, and Sam was made fun of for his intelligence. I felt it was almost more gritty (or as much as it could be) for a kid's show.Even the main characters weren't likable a lot of the time. Mainly Otto with his cocky personality but all of them had something disagreeable. Sam's wimpyness, Reggie's smart Aleck attitude, and Twister's inability to say anything remotely smart were all factors in showing how no one is perfect.Then of course, as a child, you find the sports they do to be amazing. I was always jealous of their talent and wished I could be as good as they were on skateboards or surfboards. In a way, they were kid's idols. And I still love them to this day.",

    "top_review": "Many reviewers here compare the Mr. Bean TV series to \"The Simpsons\", \"King of the Hill\", and other comedy shows. Though many shows at times employ slapstick, \"Mr. Bean\" is very different from the majority of these shows and their characters. The most glaring contrast is between what constitutes as humor in \"The Simpsons\" and \"Mr. Bean\". \"The Simpsons\" can sometime present gory themes in an offhanded way (eg, Itchy & Scratchy), making ethically questionable images and situations funny to the audience. The humor in part lies in the blase way in which the characters treat something like murder, torture, etc. However, I don't find that very enjoyable. That is why I applaud Rowan Atkinson for proving that slapstick humor can still be funny without turning murder and torture into light-hearted entertainment. Mr. Bean maintains an innocence that, for me, is a welcomed relief from the harshness of the TV landscape in general. From reality TV shows where participants backstab each other for money to shows like \"South Park\" and \"The Simpsons\" that fuel their comedy with questionable material, TV land can be a harsh place thesedays.Many people may feel that Mr. Bean is childish and foolish, but his is by far a gentler character than many you would meet on TV nowadays. I don't wax nostalgic for shows like \"Leave It to Beaver\" or any of those black and white TV shows where everyone is super cheery and pretend death and homosexuality don't exist. But need we go to the other extreme and portray the world as treacherous, dangerous, and continuously in conflict? Maybe what some people want when they get home from work is to sit down on the couch with a cup of hot cocoa and forget all their problems as they indulge in the foolish yet heartwarming character that is Mr. Bean.Mr. Bean takes you away from your divorcing parents, your backstabbing co-worker, your bills piling up on the table, your annoying household chores, the clogged drain in the kitchen, your sister's frantic wedding plans, and all the depressing murders and robberies on the nightly news. Mr. Bean takes you away from all this for 25 glorious minutes and into his simple-yet-complicated little world where the biggest problem is learning how not to bite off more than you can chew.It is nice to go to a simpler place where problems don't get more complicated than a stuck fly while trying to impress the queen.",

That's kind of the point.Also, be wary of any review that is almost entirely predicated on one person's opinion that a particular actor is being misutilized - especially if it's obvious that this person holds that actor in inflated esteem. The acting, so far - only one episode in - is pretty spot on.Danny McBride has a gift for depicting totally unrelatable, yet not entirely unsympathetic misanthrope. He delivers extremely inappropriate dialog without cracking the thin veneer of believability. Walton Goggins, in his characteristic Alabama accent, plays foil to McBride as a character who the viewer can believe actually likes his fellow human beings. Both of them are, in their own ways, shameless self-promoters and viciously ambitious career climbers who totally overlook the fact that they've abandoned their moral compass in pursuit of a less than lofty goal.The only weakness I can really point to is the family scenarios and the relatively unbelievable ex-wife's new husband - a character in his mid to late 40s who dresses and acts like a one-dimensional talking Hot Topic mannequin.I'm interested in where they take the next several episodes and I'd recommend checking it out if you like dark humor or any of the actors involved.",

    "top_review": "Taxi was, during it's five-year run, the most funny, engaging, memorable, and heartbreaking show on television. The show helped to redefine situation comedies and created a handful of classic characters. The show revolves around the drivers at the Sunshine Cab company: Alex Rieger (Judd Hirsch) was the good-hearted mensch who finds himself solving everyone else's problems. Bobby Wheeler (Jeff Conaway) is an aspiring actor and ladies man. Tony Banta (Tony Danza) is a struggling boxer who can never seem to win a fight. Elaine Nardo (Marilu Henner) is a single mother of two with dreams of opening her own art gallery. Reverend Jim Ignatowski (Christopher Lloyd) is an absolute space cadet, and Louie DePalma (Danny DeVito) is surely the nastiest, angriest, most miserable boss in history. Thanks to DeVito's charm, he is still somehow lovable.Besides the great acting in \"Taxi,\" there was the writing- always funny and often bittersweet without ever being maudlin or melodramatic. There are episodes that can make you laugh so hard you cry, and vice versa. Thanks to the genius of director James Burrows Taxi stands as one of television's best shows. And who can forget the haunting theme by Bob James?If you get a chance to see \"Taxi,\" take it... here's hoping it gets a DVD release in the near future.Grade: A+",

    "critic_rating": "6.2", 
    "top_review": "It's easy to forget (or not even know) that at one point, Beverly Hills, 90210 (created by Darren Star who'd go on to Melrose Place before the phenomenon that is 'Sex & The City') was the biggest teen-orientated show in the world. Yes - the world! One minute, it was struggling to survive and the next, the stars of the series inspired scenes reminiscent of 'Beatlemania'. And justly so because in those halcyon days of yesteryear, 90210's blend of drama, cheese, humour, pure unadulterated escapism, great scenery in terms of cast and location and strong characterisation was compelling viewing. The early years concentrated on the Walsh family - who promptly became the emotional core of the show - and their efforts to adjust to life in Beverly Hills after relocation from Minnesota. Twins Brandon and Brenda (Jason Priestley and Shannen Doherty) befriend a diverse group of mostly-rich rich kids at West Beverly High: spoilt son of a movie actress, jock and joker Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering), persistently in trouble and always relying on Brandon to bail him out. Brainy (but not as affluent) crusader Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris) doomed to an unrequited love for Brandon. Ditzy, naive Donna Martin (Tori Spelling) - probably the most (in)famous virgin on American TV. Insecure, school DJ David Silver (Brian Austin Green), desperate to be accepted by the gang. Blonde bombshell Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) who'd go on to sleep with her best friend's boyfriend and also, her ex-boyfriend's best friend. And last (but by no means least), moody alcoholic Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) - the quintessential troubled teen.From High School (Seasons 1-3) through to College (Seasons 4-7) and life after College (Seasons 8-10), they face a series of crises together ranging from the death of a friend to depression, drugs, physical and sexual assault and tumultuous love triangles.The earlier High School years are undoubtedly the best; the original cast is intact, the strongest scripts are to be found within this time frame and it's the period that, to this day, defines the show. However post-Shannen Doherty and with Tiffani-Amber Thiessen as vivacious, vampy schemer Valerie Malone and Kathleen Robertson as the acerbic, sarcastic Clare Arnold on board, 90210 remained very entertaining viewing right up to College graduation at the end of Season 7 - notable as the episode in which High School sweethearts (and future spouses) David and Donna finally consummated their long on-again/off-again relationship. Admittedly, the last three seasons are weaker than previous ones. A deadly combination of changes to cast and crew (it survived the loss of Darren Star, Shannen Doherty and Luke Perry in Season 6 but to all intents and purposes, the show ended with Jason Priestley's departure in Season 9. Not even Luke Perry's return could compensate for that), a more overt soap opera format and weaker new characters (embodied by the faux-Dylan imitator Noah Hunter ineptly played by Vincent Young) sounded the death knell for a series that had become a shadow of its former powerhouse self.Still, in the cutthroat world of TV, you've got to have something very special to last ten years on an American network and that's exactly what Beverly Hills, 90210 did. It outlasted all its contemporaries such as the infinitely superior teen drama 'My So-Called Life' starring Clare Danes and Jared Leto, which only made it to air for a year, and it gave the likes of 'Buffy', 'Party of Five' and 'Dawson's Creek' a recipe for success to follow. Love it or hate it (and I LOVE it) - Beverly Hills, 90210 is a TV institution.",

    "top_review": "Kara Zor-El, or Supergirl, is the daughter of Superman's uncle Zor- El and his wife Alura. Due to the fact that Krypton was dying, Kal El (Superman), and Kara Zor-El, were sent away to Earth where they could thrive and survive. Though both were sent so they could live, Kara was also sent to protect Kal-El; however, just as her pod was leaving Krypton's atmosphere, the planet exploded and the shockwave sent her pod off course into the Phantom Zone, a prison dimension used by Kryptonians. This prison dimension was originally discovered by Jor El, Kal El's father, and used by the Kryptonian Council as a humane prison. Although the zone is a barren wasteland, people trapped in the zone cannot grow old or die. As a result of being trapped in the Phantom Zone, Kara arrived at planet Earth several decades later only to discover that her cousin, Kal El, whom she was supposed to protect, was a full grown adult called Superman. After being adopted by the Danvers family, Kara slowly follows into the footsteps of her younger cousin as both a journalist and a Superhero known to the world as Supergirl.Unlike other DC television series that have a darker and violent atmosphere that might be unappealing to some, \"Supergirl\" is a cheerful, action packed series that is both entertaining and amusing. That being said, it would have been nice if Supergirl's look were a little more modernized to match her appearance in the NEW 52. Although there are a few cheesy moments, Kara's innocent, energetic, quirky, playful personality makes \"Supergirl\" enjoyable to watch. In the end, \"Supergirl\" is a fun and interesting series that has excellent potential. That being said, the acting needs some improvement as the cheesiness of the show can sometimes come across as fake, or amateurous. Additionally, the writers as well as the researchers need to get there facts straight as a native citizen of the planet Krypton is a Kryptonian and not a \"Kryptoniese\". As for those of you disliking it from just the pilot episode, you should examine/recognize this shows potential as there are a lot of amazing TV shows that had a rocky start.",

Years later, Kara Danvers is a young professional adrift in a thankless job until a fateful crisis ignites a sense of purpose using Kryptonian powers she had long hidden. Inspired, Kara decides to emulate her cousin's superheroic ways, only to find her foster sister introducing her to the secret Department of Extra-Normal Operations, dedicated to fighting alien menaces including those Kara inadvertently led to Earth.

    "critic_rating": "7.8", 
    "top_review": "Brotherhood is one of my new (and third) favorite television series. My other two favorites are Sopranos and The Wire. This series is similar in its genre to \"Sopranos\" and \"The Wire\" but it is MUCH DARKER. I highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys dark (in a violent, not funny, kind of way) films. In fact its one of the darkest depictions of the human condition I've ever seen on any screen. What separates this show from other gangster series (such as the Sopranos) is that it is almost impossible to find a character to like; unless of course you like bad guys (Michael is my favorite character). Rule #1 of Brotherhood is that there are NO GOOD GUYS; that is to say this series depicts the evil side of nearly every character in the series, including the women and children, hardly ever showing anyone in a positive light. The mothers are bad, the daughters are bad, the politicians are bad, and the gangsters are bad (but not much worse than the politicians by contrast; which I believe is one of the major themes of the show.) In Sopranos some of the gangsters are at least a slight bit likable but not in Brotherhood.For those of you who don't already know, the story is based on the true life of James J. \"Whitey\" Bulger, the second longest running guy who is currently of the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted List. You can read about on Wikipedia (WARNING: reading about Whitey might spoil some of the upcoming events in the series as many of them are similar to events in his real life.) A lot of the details are changed like the time frame (Bulger reigned during the 80s) and the location (Bulger was in Boston, Michael is in Rhode Island). And yes, Whitey Bulger did has a brother who was into politics, going from President of the State Senate in Massachusetts to the President of UMASS, where he was working until his brother was added to FBI's Top Ten.Overall the writing, acting (especially Michael), and directing are fantastic. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in this genre, or in the Irish Mafia. I would not recommend it to children or sensitive adults simply because it's such a dark series, it is so well made it can even be depressing at times.",

The past series that I've watched have so many flaws I can count them on 10 hands, but this... flawless so far! Okay, the theme song is pretty weird, but I kind of like that too.I love that it's more about the high school years with Gwen Stacy (something that was left out of the 1st film Grrrr!) Though I seriously doubt that the producers will kill the animated Gwen :P That's not likely. Plus they're keeping faithful to the comic by making Mary Jane's identity a mystery. Nice!Compared to the 90s show, the animation is consistent from one episode to the next. In the 90s series artists got lazy and repeated scenes or it was drawn crappy one weekend, then beautiful the next. Spectacular stays clean and well drawn. Even the action sequences are clean, like Spidey's movements are so well done it's hard to believe. And thank you so much for not incorporating 3D buildings....yuck! Spidey's jokes are funnier than they ever been in any previous series as well. The villains give him plenty of ammo.Speaking of villains, they are so strategically placed throughout the series it's amazing (no pun intended). Their stories are not rushed like the 90's show. He's not babbling on and on about some girl while fighting the baddie and then the scene gets cut back and forth sporadically. I can't say anything bad about this show... yet. But I doubt that they'll give me a reason to. So until this one goes belly up, make mine Marvel!",

    "top_review": "Network: Showtime; Genre: Drama; Content Rating: TV-MA (for nudity, simulated sex, graphic sexual dialog and profanity); Available: DVD; Classification: Modern Classic (star range: 1 - 5) Seasons Reviewed: Complete Series (6 seasons)Llene Chaiken's \"The L Word\" is an ensemble melodrama that plunges us into the world of a tight-nit group of lesbians including Bette (Jennifer Beals) and Tina (Laurel Holloman), a long-time couple trying to start a family, bi-sexual creator of \"the chart\" Alice (Leisha Hailey , inspired as the comic relief), grating, tortured newcomer Jenny (Mia Kirshner), sex-magnet and hair-stylist to the stars Shane (Katherine Moennig) and celebrity tennis player Dana Fairbanks (Erin Daniels). Once the show starts rolling, the characters sink their teeth into you and don't let go. If HBO is the standard setter, Showtime has carved out a niche \"answering\" HBO. A niche series played so specifically to a sliver demographic it could only work on Showtime, \"L\" is a strong-fisted answer to \"Sex and the City\" - though different in every possible way. Stripping away the romanticized fairy tale of the relationship show, \"Word\" runs on pure, naked authenticity. While it lacks \"Sex's\" intellectual pontification, everything - everything - about \"Word\" feels real. A gay marriage coupled coupled with a gay divorce, the excitement of new love coupled with the misery of a cheating partner, and sex is sometimes a beautiful expression of companionship and sometimes a meaty, awkward, disgusting mess. \"L\" has a late night Showtime inclination to titillate, but often the sex scenes and plentiful gratuitous nudity are the dullest part. You don't need a man to ruin your life, these women make each other miserable all on their own. The dramatic outbursts are raw and, at their best, difficult to watch. The performances are precise and jump boldly and with full commitment through each flaming hoop and some sloppy writing.In these PC times it is hard not to talk about a show like \"L\" without stepping into the middle of a political firestorm. In some ways the show brings this on, from a hyper-defensive title to some unnecessary posturing in its more manipulative story lines (a to-the-camera speech by Gloria Steinham is a low point). There is no mistaking that, \"L\" has an out-in-your-face feminist agenda to shake up and reshape the world's traditional norms with the questions posed by the simple existence of the characters. What defines a marriage? What defines sex? What is art? What defines a parent/grandparent? It is all fascinating stuff. A few years ago this all may have been mind-blowingly iconoclastic material, but now with homosexuality the new media sacred cow, \"L\" is given a free license to do whatever it wants.The difference between this show and others is that it takes full advantage in exploring this fertile ground. It doesn't fall back on its identity, taking for granted an audience that is starved for intelligent entertainment, but explores and expands beyond the one-note characters of \"Will & Grace\" or simply identifiable caricatures of \"Queer Eye\". Instead it is a multi-layered tapestry playing like a little epic, spanning the lesbian experience. I won't say that \"L\" is going to \"strike a civil rights blow\" for \"progressives\", but I will say that its sliver demographic has never been so well spoken for and the show never stops going all out to entertain. First and foremost a relationship series, \"L\"s characters open the door for some truly unique plot lines \u0096 such as Alice's relationship with a lesbian identified man, Dana's fianc\u00e9 planning the first gay celebrity wedding out from under her and, the big season 1 question, Jenny's moral crisis over cheating on her male fianc\u00e9, Tim (Eric Mabius, given dignity few shows would allow), with another women. The weak link in the chain is Pam Grier as Bette's heterosexual sister Kit. The show about grinds to a halt when she appears to sing or whine about her alcoholism.The production is beautiful all around. With a little imagination the show-runners have broken the restraints of the genre, as with the surreal sequences that evolve around Jenny's pretentious novels. The musical choice is always spot-on. The show is bathed in an atmospheric soundtrack (many remixes of the show's fun and boisterously embarrassing season 2 theme) and, minus that, the ambient noise of passing cars and motorcycles on the LA streets. \"L\" washes the audience in atmosphere.The first season climaxes in a knock-down brawl between Bette and Tina the likes of which I've never seen. In \"Liberally\" Bette's battle with a fanatical Christian group is brought to a stirring climax. \"Lonliest Number\" takes the show into more surreal territory. The show's best moments are when it lightens up and just lets the characters have fun together. In \"Let's Do It\" the gang set up a sting to see if Dana's crush is on their team. \"Looking Back\" finds them on a trip to the Dina Shore Invitational and recounting \"coming out stories\". At the end of the day the show is elevated on the backs of the cast, their chemistry, and the honest crafting of these characters. \"L Word\" could have coasted by on a lesbian theme, but it doesn't settle for doing anything easy and becomes so much more. After the 3rd season the quality goes downhill, stories are recycled, ending in a scattershot final season and one of the most ridiculous, mis-calculated messes of a series finale I've ever witnessed. Still, I'm the exact opposite of the demographic this narrow-cast series is going for and I can't get enough. The mark left by a great series is one that creates a world that you would want to live in, and \"L\" puts you right in its universe. \"The L Word\" is a soulful, addictive thing of beauty - often surreal, at times maddening - and a remarkable pure character drama.* * * * / 5",

    "summary": "'The L Word' follows the lives and loves of a group of lesbian friends living in Los Angeles. The main character, Jenny, is a recent graduate of the University of Chicago, who moves to Los Angeles to live with her boyfriend Tim and begin a professional writing career. Jenny's life is turned upside down when she attends a party hosted by Tim's next-door neighbors, Bette and Tina, a lesbian couple who are about to take the step into parenthood after being together for seven years. A brief encounter at the party with Marina, the owner of the local coffeehouse, suddenly has Jenny thrust into a whole new world that makes her question her own sexual orientation.

    "top_review": "Spawn has, for quite some time, being the grounding stone of Image Comics. Image is the third largest retailer in the US and UK. Marvel, the leader, has names such as Spiderman, X-Men, Capt America, Hulk and a never-ending list of other heroes. D.C., the second, has Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and a whole load more. And Image has Spawn. There are a few others, but most would not have heard of them. This is just a brief glimpse at the popularity of this single character whose sales in comics alone support the mammoth of a company that Image is.The animation runs over three seasons (also referred to as three feature-length movies) and each season is split into six twenty-five minute episodes. On DVD, the seasons run as individual films. This is a total running time of a little over seven hours, as each film is about two and a half hours. And within these seven hours, is everything one could possibly want from Spawn. Without giving away essential plot points, it is safe to say that the basic, original story of Spawn which is covered over the first couple of dozen comics and the not-so-well-received movie, is covered in the first season. The second and third seasons are also true to the comics, but are a deeper insight into the legend of Spawn.The animations are slightly in manga style (only very slightly, taking the few better elements of manga and mixing it with conventional western cartoons), but are also western enough so as to keep the gritty feel that the original comics generated. There is an abundance of blood (I would say gore, but it is all spurting blood and little guts), plenty of swearing and a whole load of nudity. Now, I am a fan of Justice League which is pure and innocent enough to be shown on day time TV. But if I'm going to go out of my way to watch an evening adult show, I do appreciate it when the makers go all out to MAKE it an adult show. It is not for the pathetic, faint of heart. It is brutal, it is hard core, and I love it to bits.Spawn is voiced by Keith David who had the most brilliant, atmospheric deep voice which captures the purest essences of what Spawn should sound like, and likewise the rest of the voice-casting is outstanding at worst. The voice overs are half what make a show like this, and when they are so precision perfect and so fantastically scripted it's no wonder that watching the film like this draws you deep into the world.And animation is well above par. Not the best I've ever seen, but that is rare and often a sure-fire sign that too much time and money has gone into too specific an aspect of the overall project. The colouring/inking and shadow work are perfect for Spawn. Most of the time the majority of the characters are cast half in shadow, and the more mysterious a character, the less you see. This applies to Spawn too, but we see plenty of him so it's fine.All in all, I can only wish there are more programs like this out there. I do believe that the audience they aim for is quite small considering all the people out there who would rather watch feel-good daytime talk shows and shopping channels than a brilliantly conceived film-noir style animation. So if this is your thing, I cannot recommend it more strongly. And if you are a fan of Spawn, lock yourself in a room with plenty of food and water for a day, because you will not be able to tear yourself away.",

    "top_review": "This wonderful new series, takes what I felt was a dubious premise, and instantly turns it into entertainment gold.I'd never liked \"ER\", though Margulies has formidable talent. Given the right character, script & director, I felt certain she could deliver. In The Good Wife she does. Her distinctive ability lies in nuance, & here she is finally given the perfect vehicle.The scripts as well as the entire cast, take directions you'd never expect. That's is the real appeal of the show. Archie Panjabi is a spiffy surprise as the \"investigative assistant\", if you will. She approaches her character as if she's the entire supporting cast of \"Shark\", (James Woods 2-season crime drama) rolled into one easy-on-the-eyes, package. She's tough, loyal, funny, & adds to the show's depth.Kudo's also, to veteran Christine Baranski for playing her \"been-everywhere...done everything\" role in a fresh way she seldom has in recent years. I watched the first episode with my wife.. (ok, FOR my wife) not expecting much at all. Boy, was I surprised. Subsequent episodes have been exponentially better, richer, & have demonstrated that THIS show simply refuses to go down already beaten paths. I really love that! I have yet to be able to predict anything at the beginning of an episode, as I can with just about any other major network drama. This show is a TV page turner...TGW is at once touching, topical, intriguing, even funny. Example: The courtroom judges are not your \"standard-TV-crime-show-judges\". They always prove to be yet another surprising element this show takes advantage of. In my opinion, this is the show's greatest strength. There ARE obvious choices at every turn in the story lines, the characters, even directorial choices, but NONE are ever followed. Prepare to be entertained and surprised.Rare in this era of formulaic crime dramas... formulaic everything on TV, \"The Good Wife\" deceives slightly, even in it's title, which almost caused me not to watch what I figured was going to be \"chick-flick-TV\". Males take note. This is simply a great show & will not disappoint.Everything in it is fresh, imminently watchable, & the result of great creative effort to not be just another law-oriented drama. IMHO, this really IS \"Must See TV\".",

    "top_review": "If you were to look up some of the most hysterical moments on the BBC, you would no doubtably come across two names. Those names would be John Cleese and Ricky Gervais. While Gervais recently found comedy through his program called 'The Office', Cleese has been providing wit, wisdom, and down-right hysteria for the past several decades. While away from his namesake (Monty Python), you can find Cleese comfortable in several other roles that showcase his bubbling talent. One of those programs just happens to be the funniest bit of crumpet called 'Fawlty Towers'. Remembering this show when I was a child and was on our local PBS station, I eagerly bought it when it was released on DVD about a year ago. Since then, I have watched random episodes here and there but never fully taking in the enjoyment from watching it all. So, today I decided to sit down and watch this series from beginning to end and I have yet to finish laughing. If this program doesn't define comic genius, I don't know what does. Never have I witnessed a show that has continually been fresh, hysterical (I cannot use that word enough), real, and outlandish all at the same time. Normally, with our current television programming, you need to pick or choose which it will be, but thankfully 'Fawlty Towers' is all of these and many more. Cleese remains in top form as Basil Fawlty, the owner/manager of the B&B that just happens to have his hands and over-worked imagination in everything. With the aid of his helpers Manuel (he's from Barcelona) and Polly (co-writer Connie Booth and ex-wife of Cleese), Cleese always seems to find himself in a heap of trouble with his wife Sybil (the dragon of the hotel). Armed with physical humor and a snake-like banter, we witness everything from a dead body, hotel inspectors, a failed anniversary party, a moose head, and a Himalayan rodent of sorts happen to this simple, everyday, B&B. This is not only a few of the episodes you will find in the complete set, but also the daily stress that Basil finds himself falling into daily.This series, again, is hysterical. Cleese is the master of his trade while proving that he can manage any task thrown in front of him. While some will argue that he overshadows the rest of the cast, I would say 'hogwash' to that. My two favorite characters in this series were Major and Manuel. The comedy that they provide cannot be found on television today. All I need to say is thank God for the BBC.

The title characters, non-stop talker Phineas (Vincent Martella) and his usually silent brother Ferb (Thomas Sangster) are suburban stepbrothers trying to make the most of their summer vacation. This means constructing elaborate gadgets like a time machine and a roller- coaster, or making a feature film. They are usually assisted by an industrious troop of Camp Fire Girls (Fireside Girls) led by their neighbor Isabella (Alyson Stoner) who has a major crush on Phineas. The brothers are just trying to have a fun summer, they aren't trying to cause trouble or be cool, and they are at that age where boys are not even conscious of girls or of who is popular. Typically their teenage sister Candace (Ashley Tisdale) gets reluctantly drawn into their projects as she strives to keep them from embarrassing her in front of her crush Jeremy (Mitchell Musso). Each storyline has her trying to \"bust them\" by phoning their mother about the latest home project, but by the time Mom gets home all evidence has conveniently vanished. Although there is a sibling rivalry the three obviously care about each other. Candace is the best part of the series and Tisdale does unexpectedly well supplying her voice; the part is very challenging, as the mercurial Candace requires a wide range of intonations and energy levels in her voice. Although the series could get by just cutting between Candace and her brothers, it ups the energy level each episode with a \"Kim Possible\" type parallel story involving the family's pet platypus Perry (he's a semi-aquatic, egg-laying, mammal of action). Perry is a secret agent assigned to foil the plots of evil (but hopelessly inept) scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz (co- creator Dan Povenmire). The animation style is the same simplistic stuff (Phineas' head is a triangle) found in the other four cartoon series although like \"SpongeBob\" the occasional \"real-life\" photo is thrown into the mix.For the benefit of boy viewers, a more serious drawing style is devoted to one of the minor characters, Dr. Doofenshmirtz's beautiful daughter Veronica (Olivia Olson). She is a goth version of Dr. Dome's daughter Lynx from DC's 1960's \"Plastic Man\" comics. \"Phineas and Ferb\" might be the all-time best \"compromise\" cartoon; incorporating many subtle elements for adult viewers while relying on its absurdist humor and identification elements to hook both pre-teens and teens. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",

Debra is not your typical sitcom mum. She's independent and opinionated, and a very good match for Ray - she keeps him in line!His Italian American parents (Marie and Frank) and divorced 40 year old brother (Robert) stay in the same street and facing across from Ray & Debra's house. And they are never away from there - The parents are very loud, expressive, overbearing people, but they don't mean to be....It's just their way. The brother is quirky to say the least! he's 7 foot tall and has a voice like Eeyore from the winnie the pooh movies (he IS the voice from the cartoon). He has weird little habits and is a little obsessive compulsive and insanely jealous of his younger brother Ray. However, at heart they are good, caring people and the family are extraordinarily close...but you'd never know it by the drama and shouting that goes on all the time! This is where the comedy comes from....Now, I am married to an Italian man and I know from experience what Italian in-laws are like! so this might be why I find this so funny....watching Marie (Rays mum) is like watching my MIL (only its not so funny in real life, believe me!!)If you like Seinfeld, King of Queens (another sitcom which took ages to grow on me), CLASSIC Woody Allen movies, the film Mambo Italiano or My Big Fat Greek Wedding, then you'll like this.

It is its storyline, its characters, its visual style and its music : a real trade mark. What I like the most is first the ritual : the tape, the dossier and the apartment briefing, then the fast-paced clips as credits, the character of Martin Landau with his masks and gimmicks, the cinematography (very quick cuts, extreme close ups as inserts, the use of special lenses, pan-and-tilt shots, upside-down camera shots, hand-held camera shots, optical zoom shots as dramatic effects), the skillful montage, and finally, the music and its various themes. The show is an impeccable and Machiavellian play. Every details are planned in advance to fool and get rid of the enemy. Each scheming is tight and shocking. I like the use of the time warp concept in \"Operation Rogosh\" and the role of Fritz Weaver as the paranoid Soviet Union spy trapped in a fake Russian prison which is in California. I like the tension and the suspense created by silent actions. Anyway, the whole show is about simulacrum. The devious methods of the IMF agents are always delightful and clever. Don't miss the best episodes : \"The mind of Stephan Miklos\", \"Live bait\" and \"The interrogator\". This tape will self-destruct in five seconds, good luck. !",

From reading other reviews it would sound as if these two men are monsters but that is not the case. They are simply bartering for items that an individual has been storing on his property for years. These collectors live in rural areas and have preserved many items that no longer exist. Yes many of them have long beards, own guns and own large tracks of land that they have stored cars, bikes and who know what else for many years. That is no reason to automatically judge them as being idiots, and bigots. Many of these men know exactly what they have and know exactly what they are worth. Also many of these men are in there 60's and 70's, some older and many feel they have to start selling there collections before they die. Many times when the guys show up to \"pick\" and they end up buying items from the widow who has know clue and just wants to get rid of her husbands collection.Frank and Mikey or a strange brew but I think its kinda of funny and entertaining. I often find myself impressed of there knowledge and how polite and respectful they our to the folks they are buying from. Many of the collectors they buy from have very deep feelings about there collection and letting go with there items. I think they do a good job of not insulting the collectors and in a way its kinda like a little bit of therapy. They talk the men into selling some of there possessions and most likely they hadn't sold anything off there property in a long time. In all this is a very good show and it is surprising because you never know what they will find.",

The plots seem a little too complicated for rural Georgia, but this was never meant to be high drama, only an hour of fun and escapism.I haven't watched the Dukes in years, but I am still affected by how much this show had an impact on me. My dog breed of choice is a Bassett hound, I always like to gun the engine of my car a little, and my eyes are always drawn to the color orange.

After a few times, I was eventually able to get past the opening theme song, which sounds a lot like a generic ring-tone on a cheap cell phone.Once past that hurdle, I watched an episode. I thought at first, due to the raving reviews, that maybe it was just a bad episode. So I tried to watch it again.I guess the problem for me is \"suspension of disbelief\" which is critical for enjoying any play, movie or TV show. I find it impossible to suspend disbelief and enjoy this show. First of all is the premise that some young skinny kid is accepted as a doctor in a hospital. It might be more believable if at least the patients were in disbelief, or at least pretended to be a bit surprised.But even if that were the case, there's Max Casella playing the role of \"Vinnie Delpino\". I was born and raised in New Jersey. Maybe people that aren't from the area can buy into his extremely fake Italian-American accent, but when if you grew up here, you too would also be a little sickened by how extremely fake he sounds. Turns out, Max Casella is from Washington DC. So it's no wonder his accent sounds almost like a stereotyped mockery of New Jersey Italians.For this reason alone, his \"Vinnie\" character is extremely annoying. And \"Vinnie\"? Really? Why not go for the gold and use the name \"Antney\"? I can see how the people who wrote and directed this abomination would completely miss the fact that \"Vinnie\" is like nails on a chalkboard every time he appears. They live in California and most likely think people from New Jersey actually say \"New Joisey\". Truth is, they don't. In fact, I've yet to meet somebody who says \"Fah get abowt it\". And so far the only person from New Jersey I know of that says \"How ya doin?\" is Wendy Williams.Sorry to go against all the positive accolades of the other reviews, but this show is not unlike smelling fresh vomit in that it makes you want to vomit too.",

    "top_review": "Buffy The Vampire Slayer, its misguided title put aside, is what I consider, and millions of other devoted fans believe to be a genuine and purely astonishing work of achievement in television history. With creative and daring story lines and terrific character development, the show that began its run on the WB as a mid-season replacement, became a dazzling cult hit resulting in a secure fan base and merchandising for as far as the eye can see.The show follows a young girl endowed with the ancient powers of the slayer, one girl who fights the forces of darkness, battling alone, relieving the world of vampires and demons. In Buffy Summers' case, after moving to Sunnydale with her single mother, she befriends two loving, but out of place peers, Willow and Xander, who bravely march along side of her. Together, along with her watcher, Giles, they encounter creatures of darkness and strange mystical occurrences, which as a result, draw them closer together and occasionally, set them apart.On occasion, Buffy is mistaken as a foolish, sci-fi television show which should probably be aired during the depressing Saturday afternoon time slot. But actually, nothing could be farther from the truth. A surprising element to Buffy is that the monsters and demons are a relatively small part of what the show actually stands for. From first love, life, death, sexual experimentation, and self identity crises \u0096 Buffy chronicles what it is like to be young person growing up in an overly mature world \u0096 with monsters! Between a slayer, a lesbian witch, a carpenter, and a werewolf \u0096 anything is possible and welcomed in the Buffy world. With the imaginative and extremely innovative writing of the show's creator Joss Whedon, along with the most intelligent and skillful writing staff that the biz has ever encountered, they were able to produce many groundbreaking episodes including \"Hush\", \"The Body\", \"The Gift\", \"Becoming part 2\", \"Seeing Red\", \"Conversations with Dead People\", \"Grave\", and \"Chosen\" \u0096 sadly I cannot continue this list for there is not enough space.Without further ado, Buffy The Vampire Slayer is and will always be an incredible show. If you haven't had the privilege of watching this show, check your local listings for reruns or rent or even buy the entire series on DVD. Without a doubt, you will fall in love with the characters and stories, and by the time you finish the first season you will have welcomed a new family into your lives \u0096 sweet and sometimes muddled Buffy, clever and endearing Willow, faithful Xander, perceptive and paternal Giles. This show will linger in our hearts for eternity, and will go on to influence generations of intellectual and audacious writing in television.",

And I completely disagree.First off, David Cross is the man, he's not gonna make a show just for the sake of making a show. He's gonna put a lot of dedication into it. Secondly, I guess I can see how you might not think this is funny if you don't get where the show is coming from. Todd Margret (David Cross) is a guy who is sent to London to sell energy drinks, and he has no experience in business whatsoever he is also a compulsive liar. A lot of the comedy in the show stems from these two aspects. And in my opinion it is hilarious. Pretty much the whole show he's just digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole (as the name of the show implies).I saw in the review that I read that the guy watched Arrested Development. If your looking for a show like this, this isn't it, And really there is no other show like that. This is the type of David Cross humor that you would love if you were into \"Mr. Show\" the sketch comedy show he had with Bob Odenkirk on HBO.Also the in this guys review he wrote that it was similar to Home Alone... WTF? Not even close, I would disregard that review completely, and give the show a chance. Because in my opinion it is great, and I can't wait for the second season to air.This is my first post on this site, but a greatly needed one, after reading the review i saw on the page.Thanks for reading.",

Whilst I am a fan of both, when I saw Black Books, I loved it!

    "top_review": "I was looking forward to this more so than the other Marvel Netflix shows, but Luke Cage is easily the weakest of the bunch. The show improves throughout its run, but it really only picks up over the last few episodes. The story is not compelling, the acting is troublesome at times (mostly early on), and Cage's story arc and motivation (or lack thereof) leaves much to be desired for most of the first season. At times it's hard to believe he's the same character who first appeared in Jessica Jones.The biggest issue is the tedium. The director appears to have a problem with story telling, but the real issue is there just isn't enough material to fill each episode. Every hour drags on and on. It's awkwardly punctuating by musical numbers that will not be appealing to most viewers with frequent cuts back and forth which simply interrupt the consequential moments of each episode instead of accentuating them.The villains are too weak for the season to drag on as it did. Cage is very overpowered in this series (far more powerful than in Jessica Jones) and there's no plausible reason he doesn't mop things up by the end of the first few episodes. To account for this, much of the show is filler. Some of the reviews I've seen remark how much character development there is on the supporting cast as one of the show's strengths. Honestly, it seems to be a glaring weakness. Not only is this too, filler, the character development is poor. It not only doesn't explain who these people really are and in fact detracts from the characters as you see how weak and ineffectual the rest of the cast is.In reality, Cage could have pimp slapped the villain out of Harlem at any point in the entire series and they could have moved on to a new and better story line.",

I like Gina and Michael and I especially like his agent, Bobbie, played with gusto but the ever talented Jennifer Coolidge.Out of all the characters, Joey stands the best chance of making it alone and I really think people need to let the show move through the natural teething problems that it will have. It's NOT Friends, just the same as Mork and Mindy was NOT Happy Days. To compare the two is asinine. Will it be better than Friends, who knows. Remember that Friends had it's own teething problems in the early days and was not necessarily the greatest show on the planet. Star Trek: The Next Generation was absolutely lousy in the first season. That moved on to spawn one of TV's greatest shows. Hell, The Simpsons was not great in it's first season. However, a show will never work if all people can say is \"This is not Friends\"!!! Give it a chance. It's worked for Angel from \"Buffy\"!",

The \"college aged\" (riiiight) boys and girls who work so clumsily toward some farce of a romance. The weird creatures with big ears and eyes that talk like 2 yr olds. All the things I can't stand. Then he brought home Hellsing. Horror cartoons? Vampires and zombies? Blood and decapitations and mutilations? My first thought was, \"Well, he's not going to let my 13 yr old son watch this but WOW! I LOVE IT!\" The animation is gritty, harsh and solid. The story is involved and keeps you hooked. They push the envelope with the death scenes but it works! \"Police Girl\" has a bit of that big-eyed look and occasionally her breasts will change size drastically depending on the supposed camera angle, but overall, she's likable. And if Alucard likes his custom made guns more than the old fashioned bite and drain, who can blame him? His weapons are a sight to see.So if can't stand anime but you're a horror fan, give Hellsing a shot! Just be prepared to watch only 12 episodes... That's all there are. :(My hubby would still like me to sit down with him and watch the cutesy stuff, but is happy that he can at least say that his wife likes *some* anime. ;)Rowan",

Sadly, it lasted only 24 episodes before getting canned. On the upside, it did win an Emmy for its theme song! That's a good thing! Anyway, there are several types of humor. Slapstick (i.e. \"The Three Stooges'), dry and sarcastic (i.e. \"Daria\"), that old Warner Brotherish humor that I'm still trying to put a name to.... and then there's \"What?!?!?!? Why?!?!?\" humor that comes out of no where and strikes us as funny because it doesn't make sense and yet it does make sense... does that make sense? Freakazoid is a delightful mixture of this kind of humor, the most obscure movie/historical/cultural references you could possibly imagine, and (lets face it) utter childishness. This is the only show you would be able to hear big-name actors like David Warner behave like a child throwing a tantrum, or hear deadpan Ed Asner say things like \"Poo-gas\", or even hear the world famous carpenter Norm Abram say something like, \"You're and evil man!\"  All of this is brought to us by the comic genius of Paul Rugg (who not only writes but does the voice of Freakazoid himself because the part was too weird for anyone else to handle) and his partner in crime, John P. McCann.  These guys wrote all the good, memorable episodes of the hit series \"Animaniacs\". I'm not sure if my rant is making much sense, so I'll stop. I cannot recommend \"Freakazoid\" to you enough.  I'll put it this way: If you enjoy humor similar to \"The Tick\" comic book (the show is much tamer than what I'm talking about), the \"Earthworm Jim\" video game, or \"Space Ghost: Coast to Coast\", this is for you!

At first, to be perfectly honest I didn't really like this show, but I gave it another chance and ended up totally loving it. And it only got better, as the series went on and more charcters were brought in (ie. Germ, Irene, Johnny), it became funnier.

Excluding the 1940's series, the other Superman cartoons look dated and cheezy if you were to watch them now. The same can be said for the Batman cartoons. This Superman series is brilliant, on par with Batman:The Animated Series.How did people make this series work? Simple. They did exactly what they did with Batman:The Animated Series and did it with this cartoon. Superman is an intelligent cartoon for adults and children with great plots, humour and plenty of action. Let's not forget artistic license either-don't you just love Superman's big jaw and Clark's big jaw as well (big giveaway there to anyone wanting to find out Supe's secret identity). It has been ten years since Batman:The Animated Series made it's debut and it has not aged at all; the same can be said for Superman.I strongly recommend this movie and also, the Batman/Superman team up movie from 1998.

    "top_review": "Ludicrous, over the top and often hilarious cartoon based on the cult comic book character created by Ben Edlund. If you've read the other reviews, you know by now that the Tick is a 7-foot tall, 400 lbs blue superhero who is in fact a spoof of other superheroes and more often than not, feels as though he were based on the Adam West interpretation of Batman (from the 1960s TV series). The Tick is ungodly strong and ungodly tough, but he's a bit too dense and cheery for his own good, so he relies on his pudgy sidekick Arthur to be the brains between the two. The City they oversee is crawling with superheroes but most of them are either incompetent or cowards or both or maybe just plain crazy (American Maid is one of the few exceptions; Sewer Urchin is a true fish out of water, as he's not very useful on land but quite a bad ass in his natural environment: the sewer), so it's usually up to Tick and Arthur to save the day.The first season was by far the best, pitting the Tick against the Idea Men, a mad chef, a giant man-dinosaur (Dinosaur  Neil), another guy who used the name Tick, a giant lava monster, a mutant killer clown, a big Jaba-the-Hutt like alien, a green clone of himself, and even Arthur's bank account among others! It's hard to believe that Townsend Coleman, who voiced the Tick, was also the voice of Michaelangelo on \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (former turtles-in-arms Cam \"Leonardo\" Clarke and Rob \"Raphael\" Paulsen also worked on this show, Clarke as Die Fleadermouse and Paulsen as the 2nd voice of Arthur).Sadly, both this show and the live action one that starred \"Seinfeld\" alumnus Patrick Warburton as the Tick, kept getting canceled by Fox. A while back I picked up \"The Tick: The Naked City\", which was a collection of the first six Tick issues done by Ben Edlund. I can't quite place my finger on it, but there was something different about the Tick in the original comic book from his cartoon and live action incarnations. The comic book humor, while still zany, was a bit darker. Seeing as how some of the original comics and classic moments from the original comics were adapted for the cartoon (like Tick tearing up Arthur's apartment because he thinks it's a secret headquarters) makes me wish they'd have adapted the ninja story line for the show or at least featured Oedipus (a ninja babe who was kind of like a spoof of the Elektra character who appeared in the Daredevil comics) and Paul the Samurai (the man with the sword disguised as French bread) once. I still haven't read or found any of the other Tick comics so I have no idea really if the comic book Tick eventually evolved into what his cartoon counterpart is or not.But overall, I loved this show and miss it greatly.",

    "top_review": "Peep Show is a highly original effort in the world of British Comedy, and the trick it uses aids it as one of the funniest comedies of the last 10 years. You do need to be slightly thick-skinned to appreciate it though...Mark and Jeremy are 2 loser flat-mates. One's got a turgid office job and is in love with a colleague, and the other, Jeremy, is the leech without a job and failing miserably to do anything worthwhile with his life.On the face of it sounds not unlike Men Behaving Badly, and there are the 2 women both guys respectively pine for; one being the aforementioned colleague of Mark, and the other being the next door neighbour who Jeremy is desperate to 'have'. However, Peep Show does 2 things which make it quite unique and laugh-out-loud funny. Firstly it adopts a first person perspective so we see the action not as a 3rd party, but from the very points of view of the characters. Not only this, but we hear their thoughts as well, which means we know what they're really thinking as opposed to only hearing what they actually say. This is a terrific twist and provides genuine hilarity throughout.The second aspect it adopts is adult humour, and by this I don't mean Viz. It uses sexual situations, drugs, booze, and political incorrectness as incredibly risqu\u00e9 and dark humour, and goes beyond anything I've ever seen before, certainly in sitcom land. It's plainly obvious why it gets an 18 certificate (UK).Furthermore, the acting itself is absolutely great, and is incredibly conducive to to the script. Because of the strength of the script and the supreme acting, there are many genuinely toe-curling embarrassing moments (But never fail to make you laugh, as opposed to just making you cringe), along with some awkward silences where, for a moment, you actually sympathise with the characters because you 'are' them. But normal hilarity resumes soon after...This is a terrific series, and genuinely funny. It will not be to everyone's taste, but if you can laugh at yourself you can laugh at this.Highly recommended.",

The professional dancers, who also choreograph the routines, are all successful ballroom dancers who never know what celebrity they might be matched with.

Since finding out about the reboot of the show through Girl Meets World, I knew it could go one of two ways. 1. It will be down-right awful. Sure, sometimes BMW could get a little cheesy, but this is Disney, it could be cheesy to the 100th power. It could be over-acted, pay no homage to all that made BMW great, be poorly written, and just be ridiculous... ORRRRRRR 2. It will be awesome. It will draw older viewers (who may now be parents of the show's target audience) in with the nostalgia of BMW, not only with cameos of stars from the original series, but also through plot lines, quotes, and details that any BMW fan would instantly grasp. It will be appropriately acted, and well written.Thankfully, after the pilot episode, I can say that the latter statement is true. I can't wait to tune in to future episodes and relive my childhood through the next generation. I believe it can stand alone without the throwbacks, but I can't say that wasn't what made me love it.Cory and Topanga forever.",

    "top_review": "Based on the fact that \"American Idol\" judge (and media mogul) Simon Cowell was behind this show, I watched its premiere episode. I was absolutely flabbergasted by the unprofessional behaviour of one of its judges, Piers Morgan. He kept pressing other judges' elimination buzzers for them, and was so quick to judge that he instantly misjudged a ventriloquist and had to change his vote to avoid looking foolish; the ventriloquist turned out to be terrific. On \"American Idol\", you may agree or disagree with the judges, but it's clear that they bring their own professional standards with them to the judging process, and apply them consistently. On \"America's Got Talent\", David Hasselhoff clearly withholds his vote (he's third in the rotation) for a time when an act is bombing,, so as to prolong whatever unintentional comedy is going on. Piers Morgan has Simon Cowell's flamboyantly sharp tongue without having established any credibility with audiences (I mean, who IS this guy, anyway?), and his reaching for other judges' buzzers is the most shameless exhibition of ego I've ever witnessed on entertainment television. Oddly enough, it's Brandy who reveals the chops, the consistency, and the empathy to make a good judge, though she's the youngest of the three. Regis Philbin emcees, and why NBC is paying that kind of money for a job that a lot of lesser lights could do just as well is beyond me; Philbin's presence adds nothing to the show's entertainment value.The talent is fine- at least the good acts are- and the idea is fine. But the execution is awful, with Piers Morgan's antics so off-putting I'm not sure if I'll watch again. If NBC wants this show to last, I suggest they get Morgan under control, and impose time standards during auditions, requiring judges to give every contestant some guaranteed minimum of time, to avoid another misfire such as the one that occurred with the ventriloquist. The main thing is to get the judges looking more impartial and professional; once the voting and elimination processes begin, the home audience is not going to take kindly to things that appear to skew a contestant's chances.",

This show really does have a bright future if they keep rolling at this pace. I must say, I am very impressed. Almost Walking Dead impressed.

They used (and abused) the medium to what was then the limit of its potential: no thirty-second \"blackout\" skits, no contrived punchlines (except in the name of self-mocking irony), performers falling out of character and addressing the audience, skits being intruded by characters from a previous sketch, or even an entirely different episode (so you had to pay attention!), stream-of-consciousness animated links, absurd props (the 16 ton weight)... and they claim they merely threw it all together when the BBC approached them to make a \"satirical sketch show\" in the vein of \"The Frost Report\" or \"TW3\".Not only that, but they have influenced probably every comedy writer and performer of note ever since.The Pythons are either authentic, top-drawer geniuses, or the six luckiest opportunists who ever lived - probably a bit of both! They caught the BBC with its knickers down and took advantage.OK, so the shows look their age, and much of the material is rambling, patchy, hit-and-miss stuff.

The lighting and set design are very appropriate for a mainstream network series. Excellent use of steady-cam and \"documentary style\" camera work.I respectfully disagree with some of the previous comments by my fellow veteran. I believe that he may not have had much contact with the spec ops community in his 10 year career.We should remember that this is a television series- If the cameras rolled in the average combat spec ops unit, it *might* last a whole episode...*might*.While the wives in this show do seem to be a very comely group, The same probably applies to the men- as is fitting for a cast of actors.If anything, the actors seem a little young to be from the unit. The average age in Delta is over 30, minimum age to apply is 22. As far as out of shape, senior soldiers don't fit the 3% body fat runner look that many young garritroopers sport.The tactics used by the actors would definitely be out of place even in an infantry unit- but I have trained with enough operators to know that they can look sloppy and distracted (unmilitary) a fraction of a second before they tear through the target. I saw one step into a room, draw, engage 5 targets, and holster in 3 seconds - Then almost get tossed off the course for not wearing a regulation helmet.While the dialog is not what we would hear in the field (too many syllables and too few profanities), it is intended to help the viewer understand and experience the flow of tension and action- which I feel it dies well.While the homes are officer and senior NCO grade, it is very similar to the newer housing at Ft. Bragg (Where the unit it most expressly not stationed).",

There are moments when watching Will Arnett as Chip that makes you completely forget that you're looking at what is usually a very funny man.Given that this was a first time writing an entire show from start to finish for Arnett, I went in with lowered expectations. While the show struggles with knowing what it wants to be in spots, the characters are deep, the inter-relationships toxic and intriguing to watch.

The creators of The Flintstones, The Jetsons, Yogi Bear, and Hong Kong Phooey; they've all been successful, but the crown jewel of their creations is Scooby Doo.Unlike most cartoons, Scooby Doo was a smart and ingenious creation that required thinking and deep thought. The adventures of four teen sleuths and their Great Dane have been a regular viewing pleasure for years. Heck, I still watch it today. The best episodes were the first ones from 1969-72. I think they got progressively better over time because in the early ones, they didn't have enough suspects; usually, they'd only meet up with the guy who was the criminal. Later, they'd have 4 or 5 guys who could be the one unmasked at the end.As for Scrappy, the only episodes worth seeing with him were when he's with the full cast, solving mysteries. I liked him here, because the act with Scooby and Shaggy always being frightened of every situation got tiresome; at least Scrappy would go right in, and Shaggy and Scooby had no choice but to follow him in, or Scrappy would egg them on. Only when they didn't have the full cast and were only in comic situations (i.e. all the other shows) would the show be awful.",

It's an obvious mock on Walmart / Target style stores (With coloring similar to Walmart), and over the top characters that we may grow to love (If the network doesn't cancel it next week that is). Hopefully this show will pull the much needed ratings to stay alive for a few seasons to gain a following.First of all Ben Feldman does a great job at portraying the typical American male - who has a bit of fun and slacks off just as much as he goofs around. America Ferrera is also doing a great job as the possible love interest of our main character. Then there's an ensemble of other great characters - with very eccentric personalities. Yes this show is stereo typical, yes this show portrays the lower class - but as the show's first joke says, sometimes one doesn't need to judge based on class, rather just sit back and enjoy the show. I think that joke was put in there intentionally - or maybe I'm reading more into it than I should.Regardless, I've been missing a good new sitcom to fit that style of eccentric humor that was in Parks and the Office. Modern Family is great, but it didn't really hit the same level of weird humor in their characters. I hope this one lasts a few seasons.",

This is the first time I have ever sensed it from watching a show. All you are doing is glamorizing criminal behavior in a bullshit fantasy way.I wonder if Cliff Curtis longs for the day he can play a Polynesian shot caller, instead of always being casted as a Cartel or Mexican Gang leader. Regardless, the show has potential. FOX needs to step it up and gut the writers and maybe the creator of the show. Put somebody who knows what he is doing in charge.5/30 Update: I guess I spoke too soon. That last episode was entertaining. I guess I wasn't stoned enough when I watched the pilot.

He could still wear a robe, but did it have to look like a potato sack? How can Batman really compete with Superman, seriously?Anyway the mix of martial arts with supernatural and post- apocalyptic themes would make most people think this is a horrible combination for a TV series ... but not if you are a fan of old Chinese martial arts movies.The fight scenes in this movie are incredible considering it is made for television. The acting isn't absolutely stunning, but acting never was in many of those Chinese movies and it was never meant to be. The main characters Danny Wu and Martin Csokas both do a satisfactory job in their roles. Emily Beecham's portrayal of the Widow has grown on me and she looks really impressive in some of the fight scenes.Some of the supporting actors, particularly the fighters, I admit leave a little to be desired acting wise, but generally ... you don't want them to do much more than lose.I believe if you over think the reality of this TV series, you may miss some of the good aspects of it, but admittedly this type of show isn't for everyone.Having just watched the first season, I loved the finale and am eagerly looking forward to seeing more.",

    "title": "Dallas", 
    "critic_rating": "7.0", 
    "top_review": "Dallas has to be one of the greatest ever TV shows, because it had all of the attributes for entertainment. It had great characters, good writers and story lines that ranged from the ridiculous to the sublime. Oh how easy it was to run an an oil company! Watching Dallas was pure fantasy, it's simply what makes TV fun and relaxing, take out an hour from the real world and enjoy, for people who saw the show they know what I mean!So there we were introduced to the Ewing's who were in a bitter feud with the Barnes. However it was the biggest mismatch since George Foreman pounded Joe Frazier into the canvas 6 times in two rounds in the 1973 heavyweight title fight. The Ewing's led by JR body-slammed Cliff Barnes around for the first two seasons. In reality it was not a fair contest, a multimillion dollar family with connections up against a small town lawyer were always going to come out on top! However, that was to change as the series progressed. Of course the show quickly centered on JR (played by Larry Hagman) and the writers created a character that people would really hate; he had no problem playing fast and lose with other peoples lives.So what did JR do that upset so many people! Swindled and cheated the cartel on more than one occasion, blackmailed politician's and government officials into helping him with his crooked deals, had the police set people up on phony charges as he had much of Braddock and Dallas police dept in his payroll. However JR wasn't satisfied with just tormenting the powerful, his family were not spared either, he was instrumental in trying to break up both Bobby, Garry and his mothers marriage's on numerous occasions. Cheated on his wife so many times that he turned her into an alcoholic and had her committed to a sanitarium. Government regulations were also no obstacle to his ambitions. He defied a State department embargo and illegally sold oil to Cuba, instigated a military coup in some oil rich country in Asia and risked a middle east war by hiring mercenaries to blow up Saudi Arabian oil fields to jack up the price of oil, and finally had a run in with the CIA and the Justice Department.It was not just Cliff Barnes he wreaked havoc on, other people were fair game too. He betrayed, conned and left many of his subordinates, business associates and former lovers twisting in the wind, either in jail, broke or on the run from the police. As a consequence of his meddling, reputations were ruined family relationships were left in tatters and ambitions shattered as he turned his back or double crossed some of his closest confidants. It doesn't get any better than this! Not surprisingly the phrase \"I'll get you JR if it's the last thing I'll do\" or \"you'll pay for this JR\" both became fairly regular clich\u00e9s as they all vowed revenge! As I write this I can count at least 5 attempts on JR's life as they tried to get even. Many would say that the golden years of Dallas were the 1978-82 seasons. That's probably true, all the characters were developed through those seasons and I think Dallas had it's highest ratings. However my personal favorites were the 1987-1990 (the last series was poor)! In 1986 with the series tottering on the edge, the writers took a chance and despite ridicule brought back the character Bobby by making the previous season all a dream. It was a risk but they resuscitated a series by binning the most boring and tired looking season in 1985/86 (and that's according to Larry Hagman too) as never happening and therefore having a fresh start to the series. To start with not everything went JRs way he lost Ewing oil, Sue Ellen started to get her act together and fight back on equal terms, Pam left the series and Bobby became a more aggressive character without her. It was a brave attempt by the creators to revive the series and they certainly pulled it off, Dallas never would have lasted as long if they had not done it! They filmed in locations such as Austria, France , Russia and gave a higher profile to the skin crawling Jeremy Wendell head of Weststar and after his exit he was followed by the lager than life Carter Mackay, who kept up the pressure on JR and the Ewing's far more than the cartel.Some of the story lines introduced scenarios from movies such as COOL HAND Luke when JR was sentenced to hard time on a chain gang , or ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST when JR in bizarre scheme bribed a judge to commit him into a puzzle house to find out information from Clayton's mentally ill sister. Even Bobby was not spared, on his trip to Paris his wife April was kidnapped very much a story similar to the 1987 movie FRANTIC. With the proliferation of satellite and cable TV the major networks sensitive to their advertising revenue delved into trash TV and the half hour sitcoms which are cheap to make. Just over the horizon audience participation shows i.e. Opra, Rikki Lake and Springer and dopey half hour sit-come's were awaiting and if you were to fast forward looming ahead were the so called reality TV shows of the late 1990's.Dallas was the first of the glam soaps and the second last to be canceled (1991). Was it all more entertaining than what's on today, well you be the judge!",

The characters either make or break a show like this, and in this case, the actors and their characters bring the entire story up. For example, the kid math-savant, a tough female DOD agent, Henry the quasi-mechanic, the tough deputy Lupo and an all-American US Marshall, who is the normal guy and now the Sheriff of Eureka. There are others of course and I am hoping the show hangs on long enough to develop a following. The setting is perfect. The writer's foreshadowing worked like a charm. Many things I assume will be happening. As I was watching, I kept saying, where's the villain?? And at the end of the first episode, a sweet villain was revealed, and in such a way -- you had to go --- Whoa -- very nice. The actor playing Jack Carter was perfectly chosen to act as us in this strange little story. Briefly, a small town hosts the world's most shining minds as they experiment and tinker with science and it's up to the normal people to keep the brains on the right path. I am so looking forward to the next installment. My hats off to the creative team -- this is just what I needed. Let's all hope we don't lose this show in the most important early stages. Ratings are King and just because it's good doesn't mean it will last. So fan boys gravitate to this show on Tuesdays on the best channel on the planet -- sci-fi!!Addition: Just saw the sixth episode. This is a show that keeps topping itself, introducing new and deeper sub-plots and literally has a dream cast. You will fall in love with Eureka.Here we are at the third season and it has only gotten better and better. This season everything's been kicked up a notch, I cannot believe the storyline of Nathan. I stand in awe of the writers, and as always one of the best TV casts in history.Fourth Season opener: While most shows hit a slump in their 4th outing, Eureka raises the bar.

Going in I had no idea what to expect and having very little knowledge of Chicago I had no bias.Let's be clear; this is no hard hitting show. This is no Southland. It's not the opposite in complete nonsensical fluff and action scenes in Hawaii Five O either. It's a show based on the incredible power of great acting and the dynamic characters that are created because of it. It uses quick and interesting flashbacks that allow you to immediately connect with the characters, as well as establish unity amongst the rest of the cast.The first episode started off the series in perfect fashion, grabbing my attention and initiating multiple story lines while throwing in a ton of action sequences and great dialogue. The main three characters are tremendous. Jennifer Beals is completely believable as the hard hitting, straight and narrow first female Superintendent who is transforming the entire force. Delroy Lindo was made for the role of Alderman Ronin Gibbons. Jason Clark plays the perfect intense Jarek Wysocki.I can't wait for the next episode and hope this show gains a lot of heat as it was thoroughly entertaining and left me wanting for more.Give it a shot if you're on the fence and enjoy shows based on solid characters and quick flowing episodes.",

I agree with another reviewer, that quibbles about historical inaccuracies, such as accents or how old so-and-so should be, are silly pedantry. I've been a Roman history buff ever since my own high school triumvirate of Caesar, Cicero and Virgil, and I say that this historical fiction is both exciting AND quite accurate with the important stuff.So far, every player has been terrific, in particular Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as Caesar and Max Pirkis as Octavian. Julius Caesar was perhaps the most complex \"great\" figure in history. Was he a great populist, trying to champion the people against the Optimates, or was he an ambitious demagogue, who was using the Roman mobs to attain the imperium? Hinds depicts this complexity perfectly, while projecting a steely will that is shared by Caesar's emerging prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Octavian. Thanks to Max Pirkis's brilliant portrayal, we can already see the no-nonsense pragmatism, ruthlessness and brilliance that will propel this boy into becoming the greatest despot in history. And what about that dissolute Mark Anthony? We can already see Actium in his face. And with Atia, I think Livia (as depicted in I Claudius) and Messalina have met their match.And midst the struggle for mastery of Rome, we see the struggle of more common folk just to make a living. Rome makes the parallel stories of the Optimates and Centurian, now Prefect, Vorenus and Legionnaire Pullo a perfect vehicle for comparing the travails of different classes \u0097 their love lives, social lives, how they treated the servants, how they practiced their faiths, how they fought. Seen from these different perspectives (which we did not get with I Claudius), we get a three-dimensional view and, for me, the closest to feeling like one is actually there of any historical fiction ever produced.And look at the production values. Is it any wonder, when we see who's behind the camera \u0097 Michael Apted and John Milius \u0097 that we have an immaculately crafted work?By their commitment to quality of production and integrity of story, HBO and BBC are demonstrating what television can be. This is a wonderful, wonderful series. Anyone with a love of history, drama and spectacle should be devouring it with delight.",

So I have a good idea of what's out there for fans. Most new sci fi is ... unscientific, to put it kindly, or just techy stage furniture with soap-opera dialogue and character development. Like most fans, what I want to watch is a great sci fi story that seriously takes into consideration the effect of technology on the world around us, and intelligently explores the possible futures of humanity. I'm also interested by stories that consider the social issues of an alternative world shaped by different forces -- what would happen if, say, people lived on different planets, or if water was scarce, or if you had to live in 0g all your life. I know no sci fi will ever rise to the standards of physics PhDs, but it would be nice if writers occasionally paid attention to one.This review is based solely on one episode so hopefully this was not a fluke, but the quality and writing are outstanding (better than most good high budget movies). Just based on this, and the fact that it is genuinely science fiction done with care, which shows great attention to detail and love for the project, I think this show should get the best word of mouth it can get. I warmly recommend it to everyone.",

This holds particularly true for anything offered by the big 4 networks. As an example watch both versions of the series \" Secrets and Lies\" and you will clearly see the difference between an off shore and a domestic take on the same story. For me there is no comparison, the original Aussi version is much more to my liking. Now to \"Crime Story\"; it takes a couple of episodes to develop but like a fine wine after it breathes a bit the content becomes richer and more accessible. I really appreciate the casting, character development is strong and the pace is just right for me. All the actors are superb, pretty much every cast member gives an honest and compelling performance. The camera work is artful, not artsy but artful, adding to the experience. It is a drama and as such there is very little to feel good about here but the story so far is strong, well told and deals with serious issues. I eagerly look forward to each new episode. My typical viewing habit is to record episodes of shows I follow and then watch 2 or more at a time. Skipping through commercials, especially for dramas, allows the story to flow and for emotional or dramatic moments to make their point and to leave a mark. If you are a reality TV watcher or do not value well staged dramas move on - there is nothing for you here. However if you enjoy a script which is well written and deals with big relevant issues, stellar acting and something different from the majority of the cookie cutter series out there I'd say give this one a try. I was very surprised when I read through the other reviews here for this fine series and found the amount of negativity that they contained. My guess is that, like myself, the audience for a show of this caliber pretty much dismiss network offerings and will never find it. Regular network viewers need the familiar and don't know how to appreciate the slower more deliberate pace of the story , the depth of the questions raised, or the skill with which this series has been crafted - this is too bad because I find the time invested to be well worth it.",

The only real similarities with Star Wars are that both are space opera, both have bad guys in armor, both had dogfights in space, and both had John Dykstra supervising the effects.  Otherwise, the biblical story of Galactica bore little resemblance to the mythical Star Wars.  Besides, Star Wars was inspired by Flash Gordon, Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, The Dam Busters, King Arthur, and the works of Joseph Campbell.  I think a series based on Exodus and Erik Von Danekan can be cut a little slack.The acting was generally good, although the child actors were not the most skilled (but, hey, they're kids).  Lorne Greene was great as the fatherly Adama, leading his people on a search for their brethren.  Richard Hatch was the mature and stoic Apollo; the cerebral hero.  Dirk Bennedict is the reckless and fun-loving Starbuck, the true fighter pilot in space.  John Colicos is the evil Baltar, traitor to his people; part Benedict Arnold, part Herod, part Hitler.  Add a well rounded supporting cast and you have a fine ensemble.Yes, there is much dated material here:  feathered hairdo's, disco clothes, social interaction; but it doesn't detract from the better stories.  The use of a unique slang was a nice idea, but a bit distracting.  The music was good and the Egyptian influences were interesting in the designs.  The uniforms were stylish and gave a sense of military symbol and function.  The ship designs were cool (can't say it any other way).The biggest fault in this series is the tendency to depart from the overall saga into homage episodes.  \"Gun on Ice Planet Zero\" was a fine remake of the Guns of Navarone and the Dirty Dozen, but it also presented a threat to the fleet and a new obstacle they must overcome.  Others, like \"The Lost Warrior\" or \"The Magnificent Warriors\" had little consequence for the fleet and tended to get bogged down.  The series was at its best when the Galactica found a new clue to the lost tribe, or overcame the Cylons to live another day.  Unfortunately, the producers didn't have a timeline in mind when they created this show, unlike Babylon 5.  Had they determined how long the journey should take, they could have avoided unnecessary episodes and concentrated on the overall saga, bringing character development and drama into the story, without losing sight of their goal.  As it was, we were teased with false Earths and little idea when the Lost Tribe would be found.  Unfortunately, when it was found, the series took a complete nosedive.It will be interesting to see what the future will bring for this series; but, for the present, I will continue to watch my tapes.  Is it too much to ask for a DVD release for the entire series?",

This is exactly what the producers, writers, directors, actors have got together to do. After watching 2 episodes I thought these kids are absolutely brilliant they are being allowed to express themselves with none of thestiffness that a script would bring about. This is especially true for the young actors but it is also true for the excellent Claire Skinner and Hugh Dennis, and you can see the delight on their faces as they react to the children's spontaneity. It just shows how powerful the technique of improvised and semi-improvised filming can be, and whilst it's not a new device, I personally believe it's greatly underused. We all know about Mike Leigh, Ken Loach, Woody Allen etc, and we constantly hear about great moments which ended up in a film which were the result of some spontaneous improvisation, and yet we steer away from this dangerous approach. I don't want to put writers out of a job, and in Outnumbered we can see once again the originality and creativity of Andy Hamilton's and Guy Jenkin's style, but they appreciate that they are part of a creative team which produces an end product greater than the sum of its parts. Let's use the technique more in 'adult' drama and comedy and not think that it only works where there are cute kids!A word too about the subject matter itself. It is so extraordinarily well-observed and accurate; I recognise 99% of what's going on on screen. Now I realise that this is a portrayal of one particular life style, and not all the truths are universal ones, but the fact that the choice of family is relatively specific should not lead to it being dismissed as a comedy for the chattering classes, as though that somehow negates its worth.",

It's witty, awkward and filled with laughs whilst infused with an pseudo-emotional undertone about his overall bad luck with the female persuasion. The cinematography, intro clips and soundtracks have an 'entourage' style and are fantastic and really add to quality of this show. The friends of Merchant in the show compliment him - and the series greatly - and overall I'm really enjoying this series so farViewers who may not like this style of comedy or S.Merch as a comic writer will most likely disagree with my views and I can completely understand as it is not for everyones taste, but those who indulge in Merchants style will greatly appreciate this series.",

    "top_review": "Network: UPN & The Cartoon Network; Genre: Animated Comedy; Content Rating: TV-PG (for language); Available: on DVD; Classification: Cult Classic (Star range: 1 - 5);Season Reviewed: Completed Series (4 seasons)In 1999 primetime animation was so in vogue for the network that even UPN got into the act. After the much hyped 'Dilbert' slowly crashed and burned on the runway, those that stuck around found a surprise gem in the next time-slot. 'Home Movies' comes from comedian creator Brendon Small, Loren Bouchard and Soup2Nuts, the production company behind Comedy Central's modest hit 'Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist'. When UPN canceled the show after not even a full season I mourned the loss and put 'Home Movies' on the list as one of those great shows that never had a chance. Then a modern television miracle happened. The show was resurrected from the dead by the Cartoon Network 2 years later and thanks to the cost effective animation (turned into the flash style) and a real nuts-and-bolts crew that pulls the show off, it went on for 3 more seasons. Given the time and freedom, it fleshed out characters, matured and improved. 'Movies' follows 8-year-old Brendon Small (voiced by creator Small) whose passion in life is making movies with his home camcorder using his best friends, Melissa (Melissa Galsky) and Jason (H. Jon Benjamin, giving Jason a hilarious and endearing sniffle in his voice), as actors. The 3 kids talk as if they have the experience of adults, and like true young elites, often mock someone for not having seen a movie that was released before their parents where born. To complicate matters Brendon's best friend is pathetic soccer coach John McGuirk (Benjamin). The show's breakout character, McGuirk isn't above blaming the kids and not his coaching abilities when they lose or to mysteriously not show up for practice leaving them to stand around in the pouring rain. Maybe it was the show's slow pace, very loose plotting and downright shabby animation, but 'Movies' was a show that I sometimes didn't look forward to watching and then, the episodes would win me over by the end reminding me what I liked about it in the first place. This is a charming and immensely enjoyable, where the humor comes in its improved naturalistic dialog, the perfectly deadpan way its all delivered and the unique, honest and fully developed relationships between each character. The bizarre friendship between Brendon and McGuirk; the banter amongst the kids; and the indescribably sweet and true-to-life relationship between Brendon and his single-parent mom Paula Small (Janine Ditullio). There's also Melissa and her father, the priceless egging-on McGuirk gives to Melissa, and Jason's own preoccupation with Brendon, candy and a fear of his bed among other tangential things. It's not a stretch to say that 'Home Movies' is the best character comedy in recent animated memory. One of the funniest aspects of this show are the movies within it. Brendon is part Ed Wood, part Max Fischer and part every arrogant prick you knew in school. He builds elaborate sets in his basement, dresses his best friend up in a wig and writes his scripts based on whatever is going on in his life - using the movies to exorcise his demons. Few series main characters are as interesting as Brendon. His passion for what he does is infectious - we laugh at his cheaply made movies because that's the joke, but we also are pulling for him and his dream. And the more absurd and nonsensical the movies are, the better, such as \"Attack of the 50 Foot Jesus\" or his history-twisting masterpiece \"Starboy and the Captain from Outer Space\" in which space heroes battle tyrannical figures George Washington, Pablo Picasso and Annie Oakley.In terms of sophistication, 'Movies' is light-years from the other Cartoon Network originals. Sometimes, however, it doesn't seem that way as writer Small and co-creator Loren Bouchard indulge in more cartoonish slapstick humor and pump the show full of annoying characters with grating high-pitched voices, dragging the gags longer than they need to be and just annoying the audience. Flamboyant, sexually confused couple Walter and Perry can prove hysterical additions - but there is only so long that the gag works. In seasons one through three the show is adult animation and deadpan humor at it's finest. I would rank 'Brendon's Choice' on a list all-time-favorite episode endings. However, in the mysteriously delayed 4th season the show becomes overrun with its annoying impulses. Characters we don't care about are given an insane amount of screen time. It seems to even infect McGuirk who is reduced to a screaming mess in 'Camp' and giant man-boobs in 'The Heart Smashers'. This season is not the best of what this show has to offer, but Small and the Cartoon Network wisely pulled out before any real damage was done.While 'Home Movies' never got the attention of more hyped up animated fair like 'South Park' and 'Family Guy', it deserves a place in that group as one of the best animated shows in recent years. Like 'Park' it is true independent television in which a skeleton crew does all the voice, writing, directing and even writing all the original songs that never cease to pop up in the episodes (the 'Starboy' theme is infectious). The show is Small's baby and (not to sound sappy) it's a celebration of the seemingly limitless possibilities of childhood. Small's series is a little gem, proving that sometimes less is more. Amid the slapstick and the screaming and the charmingly simple 2 dimensional, is a morality play and a fully constructed character comedy. A work of honesty - subtly funny, intelligent, and fully satisfying, this show is worth the time it will take to acquire a taste for it. A modest cult classic. * * * * / 5",

I'm and old critical care and than ER RN; and I never liked working with kids. Mostly because of the parents. I was leery of it because I thought they were going to turn it into just a sob fest. But I was pleasantly surprised. It has an interesting way of telling the story; namely using the voice of a young boy in a coma who shares a room with another pt.. The medical story line not very well done; but hopefully they'll get better at that. For the most part it remains fun. It's just hard for me to watch them have a surgeon pushing a patients cart that's taking him to surgery. This never happens. I'm a big fan of Octavia Spencer but they have her giving orders for things that a doctors orders are necessary for. And she even runs a code that no doctor even showed up for. But these are relatively minor; the facts are this is a well written and acted show. I'll be watching more.",

And some people get away with everything and anything! Mostly Serena and Blair of course.And still I can't hate it. It's a show you need to watch and don't think. Seriously, do NOT try too figure out if there is any realism in it... because there isn't any.And don't get me started on the fashion and riches, but that's a personal thing.

Psycho-Pass is a very smart series that deeply analizes freewill and whether or not a person's \"hue\", when cloudy, can determine if they will become a threat to society. Using a special weapon known as \"The Dominator\", detectives are able to continuously read and send psychological data to determine a persons crime coefficient. Depending on how clouded a persons \"hue\" is, they will either receive mandatory rehabilitation, or an execution on the spot.At first I was not going to give this anime a chance, but I am thrilled I did! I love the dark, mysterious, and serious atmosphere of this anime. Additionally, the logical questions postulated regarding aspects of freewill and whether or not a person can be judged before they commit a crime were magnificent! Furthermore, every character added a significant element that made them both likable and unforgettable. Finally, the animation was beautiful, and the music significantly heightened every situation. In many ways I would say this series is already comparable to a series like \"Cowboy Bebop\".In short, Psycho-Pass is a juicy sophisticated anime that will appeal to many mystery/sci-fi fans. It is animated craftsmanship and definitely worth the watch.",

Bender, Fry, Leela, Hermes, Zoidberg, all of these characters are well thought out and work incredibly well together, on top of the fact that situations and anecdotes from previous episodes are brought up all the time, adding continuity to an already excellent series. I'll admit that I too was among the people crying foul when Futurama first came out, I didn't grow to truly appreciate it until it was put in syndication on adult swim, and more so later as I bought all the episodes on DVD. I don't think the world was ready for what futurama had to offer when it first came out, and everyone should give it another shot through adult swim or by DVD rental. It has solid entertainment value, and a unique comedic style.4.5 out of 5 stars",

    "top_review": "Think of White Collar as a little bit \"48 Hours\" (the Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte classic) and a little bit \"Catch Me If You Can\" (the DiCaprio & Hanks rollick). \"Law & Order\" this ain't. Call it \"fun TV\".The premise: What do you do with an amazing criminal mind (white collar, of course) frittering away in a super-max prison, that he can apparently escape from at will? The answer soon comes when said genius criminal Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) offers to help the FBI agent who originally caught him solve a case that's been frustrating him for years. Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) while wary, realizes this \"may\"...repeat \"may\" be a way to finally catch the bad guy.. White Collar is another USA \"Characters welcome\" offering, and it's a great one.Tim DeKay is pitch perfect as the agent who lives his job. He has a kind of \"Tom Hanks meets young Jack Lemmon\" quality that is spot on for the tone of the show. He's written as real guy in a tough spot. He truly loves his wife, but tireless dedication to \"the job\" causes him to forget anniversaries, and regularly arrive home after his wife is long 'a bed. His wife Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen) often eats dinners alone... well, sort of.Matt Bomer, soon to be a household name, vaults from his supporting role of Bryce on \"Chuck\" straight into a major lead role that fits him like a glove... like he was born to do this. Along with class A hunky good looks, Bomer also has a vulnerable quality that is quite touching. Ladies, he's Oooo so cute, slick, smart and gosh darn lovable, that your significant other may actually allow you to gaze... This show has something for everyone. The story line is not at all predictable. You want to watch how this might end.Tiffani Thiessen is actually a lovely surprise, having matured nicely as an actress from her 90210 days. Amazing for a pilot, there is sweet gentle chemistry with her FBI hubby. This FBI version of the \"truly odd couple\" takes straight off on a smart, well written, snappy crime-solving adventure. The dialog is zippy, and once the obligatory plot setup is laid down, the laughs come early and often. This too makes White Collar good family entertainment. If the series follows the pilot's lead, there will be ZERO gratuitous violence, another reason to appreciate the show. Caffrey charms and disarms all creatures great and small, while using his near savant abilities to see what the FBI cannot. The lead characters are perfectly complementary. The casting is sublime. Even the score is hip, something that USA recently seems to have cornered the market on.Personally I can't wait for the next installment of what promises to be a seriously entertaining and original show.",

    "top_review": "Let me preface this by saying I have seen all the episodes of the BBC version. I love it. I also love the new US version.Anyone who has read anything about this show (rather than just taking to the internet to spew fury all over everywhere) knows that the US version will be following the UK version, roughly, as far as the end of the first series. The first 13 US eps will mirror the first 6 UK ones. None of the US writers or actors have seen any more of the UK show than the first 6 episodes in order to make the show different in later episodes. What I am interested in seeing is what the US version does after the first 13 episodes, because it will be \"original\". Hopefully.So far, the US version has made one important improvement on the UK version: the \"ghost\" rules (ie How Sally/Annie can interact with the world) are much clearer. Frankly, the extent to which other people in the UK version can interact with Annie has always been a little murky (read: plot-servicing). I enjoy the clarification of the rules in the US version. I am willing to see what else the US version does. Some things may be better, some things worse. Without giving the show a chance, we'll never know.It is important to note that SyFy (and Space, its Canadian buddy) primarily air reruns of old SciFi shows produced by others. Original in this context means they are producing it. Yes, linguistically tricky, but so is everything in Show Biz. Bear in mind that BSG was also a remake, just more time had passed and the series was darker. Also, excellent, which gives me hope for Being Human.I have no trouble watching both shows. Liking the US one doesn't take from liking the UK one. They both have humour, likable characters, and an engrossing storyline. If you like SciFi, Fantasy, or horror genres, give this show a whirl.",

    "top_review": "Netflix's new monster mystery Stranger Things isn't the first attempt to recapture the vibe of the 80s horror/adventure films \u0096 J.J. Abrams' Super 8 comes to mind \u0096 but you've never seen anything quite like this series. The show is essentially genre-less, with numerous references and allusions to that time period weaved into a mysterious sci-fi horror tapestry that ends up being something wholly unique and utterly engrossing.. It is set in Hawkins, Indiana in 1983 and revolves around the disappearance of young Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) as his family, three misfit friends, and the town Sheriff look for answers, but instead stumble across an unexplainable and horrific chain of events. Everything has a wonderfully dark, 80's feel from the start with its synth soundtrack to the neon letters of the opening titles..This series is very much a \"kids with bikes\" type adventure akin to the darker moments of E.T. and The Goonies. The nerdy boys and their pop-culture references coupled with a love of D&D make them immediately endearing and lovable \u0096 which makes the danger they face that much more intense, as they're such easy characters to become emotionally invested in.The kids in Stranger Things are just fantastic in every single role. Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin aka \"Toothless\" will most likely become everyone's instant favorite with his harmless look, exuberantly geeky personality and constant swearing. But all the kids are very capable in their roles and bring their own dynamic to their fellowship. Finn Wolfhard is solid as Mike, the awkward de facto leader of the group, alongside Caleb McLaughlin as the fiery, but level-headed Lucas..Overall It is a great series,Stranger Things also has some gorgeous supernatural environments and creature designs. After working on the excellent first season of Wayward Pines, The Duffer brothers know how to build tension without giving everything away too easily, and sci-fi horror fans will love the references to 80s classics and the other-worldly monster himself.",

The Story is about a young half witch/ half mortal called Sabrina Spellman (Melissa Joan Hart) and she went to live with her Aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick) and their world dominating mad cat Salem Saberhagen (Voiced By Nick Bakey). My favourite character (s) are Sabrina because Melissa Joan hart is a very funny comedy actress and she can make everything funny (plus shes fine), Salem because he makes me laugh all the time i watch him Nick Bakay is a very talented actor and Aunt Hilda, Caroline Rhea is the best actress on the whole show because she portrays wacky Hilda with brilliance. This show was very funny when they had Mr Kraft, Libby Chessler and Harvey Kinkle but it went down hill when they brought in talentless actors and actress, such as that girl from Clueless and Solei Moon Frye who is not a good actress at all.In Conclusion i give the School Years of Sabrina 10/10 and the College years a 7/10 because i felt that it lost its sparkle after this!

Wonderfully written script is full of secrets and surprises. You just can't predict what is going to happen next.All the actors are magnificent. (But Cansu Dere is trying so hard. She is god awful actress.) Especially Kenan Imirzalioglu (which is the best actor of his generation) and Tuncel Kurtiz are awesome. Tuncel Kurtiz's character Ramiz Karaeski is a phenomenon.

I love how he will make fun of ANY political party; so many shows just spend their time panning Republicans, losing half the country as a result. Oliver must be a libertarian, because he very fairly simply makes fun of anyone who is doing something stupid, regardless of political affiliation. This is something that cannot be said of the unbearable John Stewart, or SNL, for example, but can be said of the awesome Lewis Black as well.I also like his way of poking fun at the U.S. - it's not condescending or rude, it's just good humored teasing. The segment in which he shows the globe with countries marked as Not the U.S. is priceless.Oliver's topics are well chosen, and his take on them is unique.

(J R-M's eyes are riveting, but that's not enough for the part b/c at this stage of Henry's life, his fame was largely due to his physical dominance, learning & musical skill.) Showtime seems to be trying to appeal to a VERY young, VH-1 audience with the J R-M casting. Or, as they suggest, to people who don't know the story.That's my second issue - don't suggest in the ads that you're going to tell the REAL story when you're not. Some dramatic license is expected (like flipping France for Portgual b/c they introduced Francis I early on) but there is no GOOD excuse for making a composite of Henry's sisters by telling Princess Mary Rose Tudor's story, but calling the character Princess Margaret, which was her older sister's name.The real Margaret had a dramatic story, too -- and she's got the line to the current royal family through her great-granddaughter, Mary, Queen of Scots -- but they lost the chance to tell that by combining the sisters. Presumably they did it b/c they thought the audience was so dumb that we couldn't handle Henry's daughter and sister both being named Mary. Too bad.",

    "summary": "This costume drama features England's splendid Renaissance dynasty under King Henry VIII. Beginning in Season 1 when Henry VIII was growing desperate for an heir and growing distant from his first wife, the series moves quickly to the period when Anne Boleyn became his obsession. During this time Cardinal Wolsey rose to become the power behind his throne, ruling ruthlessly and nearly absolutely while Henry (played by Johnathon Rhys Meyers) for the most part followed the Cardinal's advice, maneuvering through a series of betrayals and plots against him. When Anne Boleyn plays much harder to get than any woman ever has, Henry begins to search for a way out of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, so that he can make Anne his wife. Needing a divorce, Henry turns to Wolsey, who promises to help him create waves of backlash from the church, as well as the Spanish Habsburg dynasty and its overseas empire. Against this background gyrate the private lives and political intrigues of several ...",

    "top_review": "When I saw who the producers are, I must admit, I felt some trepidation. The Borne Trilogy was good (no self-respecting film lover could deny it), but hardly TV series material. All my trepidation flew out of the window less than five minutes into the pilot. I'm not an easy judge to please, but I must say, I'm hooked.The characterization was fabulous. The writers laid the strong foundation of the friendship/confidant relationship that few shows have managed to convey, and it's just the pilot. I can't wait to see how it's built up. The last time I saw such a thing, it was in BONES, and that was in the middle of the first season. Piper Perabo plays a smart, overachieving spy missing the stop-digging-yourself-into-a- hole complex. Her character is balanced by a great performance by Christopher Gorham as Auggie, your friendly neighborhood blind tech-guy, a comforting voice in the madness of the \"Agency\". To top off the show, you have their boss, a preoccupied career woman used to having to find her own way in a job traditionally held by men: Joan Campbell, played by Kari Matchett. For those of you thinking it's just another ALIAS, you've got another thing coming, just as I did. The only things it's got in common with J. J. Abrams' hit show is the CIA and strong woman lead. It has the action of all the best action films of the decade and the reasonably- subtle humor of BURN NOTICE and CHUCK. COVERT AFFAIRS is in it for the long-run. I don't plan on missing a moment of it. If it's canceled, it'll prove to be as big a mistake as canceling FIREFLY. Watch it. You won't regret it.",

Pre-Batman era never seemed so awesome! :D The plot seems elaborate and the way the story is spreading and building up suspenses, we can definitely expect a pretty epic ending. And I really don't want the ending to come anytime soon! The cinematography was absolutely awesome. Though it has a distinctive Dark Knight feeling, it also differentiates itself from any other Gotham city. The simultaneous filthy and sophisticated city is given a perfect amalgam of all other Gothams, picking the finest features! The series also has a subtle dark tone in it that really gives you a chill. The score was pretty good even for a movie, and definitely out-stands almost any TV series. The acting was well out of the league. I liked Jim Gordon's cast (Ben McKenzie). Robin Taylor (cast by Oswald Cobblepot) seemed promising too. The large chunk of antagonists would make for a great rivalry. And Falcone might as well turn out to be another mastermind villain like Jim Moriarty! And boy, wouldn't that be something! It's a Batman series without the Batman! Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. For now, Gotham can do with Jim Gordon! :D",

Just when I think I've caught my breath, a voluptous brunette walks past and he blurts out, \"Major Hooters,\" only to save himself from her wrath by introducing himself as his alter-ego, \"Major Bob Hooters.\" This was the kind of writing and creativity that made this under-appreciated series a hit for almost ten years as NBC floated it all over it's schedule. Yet, the fans continued to follow it. The other thing that made this show was sexpot Crystal Bernard, a survivor from the last season of Happy Days. The show had an incredible ensemble of talent including Bernard, Weber, Tim Daly, David Scramm, Rebecca Schull and Thomas Haden Church who played the slightly annoying mechanic Lowell Mather. Replaced by the dynamic Tony Shalhoub as the haplessly unlucky Antonio Scarpacci, the series even became a cousin to the equally successful Cheers with crossovers with its best talents. Underrated for its time on TV, this incredibly funny and relentless series lasted an enjoyable seven years until Amy Yasbeck joined the cast as Helen's jinxed sister, Casey, possibly named after Bernard's Happy Days character, K.C. Cunningham. Yasbeck's arrival signified the sign that the series had run out of ideas as Daly and Bernard's characters got married for the marriage jokes and millions of Crystal Bernard fans lost their hearts.",

'Homeland' is the new Showtime Drama that entertains you throughout and never lets you go, thus succeeding in slipping in some really unexpected twists in the plot. With writers who've previously written for '24', the show does look inspired when it comes to keeping the audience in the dark.The show is blessed with a small but amazing cast whose performance is worth every penny. Claire Danes plays an intense CIA analyst who believes that recently recovered P.O.W. (Damian Lewis) is plotting to attack America. Her character is unstable and makes it hard for the audience to believe her which adds to the beauty of the script. Damian Lewis, on the other hand, plays the 'guy in uniform' with ease as he did splendidly in 'Band of Brothers'. The show hasn't revealed much about Damian's character and I have a feeling they wouldn't do that any time soon, since it keeps the suspense going.The pilot was top-notch and certainly the best that premiered this fall. If the show continues to be intriguing and maintains the high quality of the pilot, it can surely be a genius.10 stars at least for now.",

Where \"Yes Minister\" dealt with hapless ministers being manipulated by the civil-service mandarins (the power brokers of the time) ... \"The Thick Of It\" deals primarily with hapless ministers being manipulated by spin doctors (the current power brokers). Spot the difference? Series one kicks off with the clinical execution of a cabinet minister (department of \"Social Affairs\") by the party communications director Malcolm Tucker, played to perfection by a fantastically high-powered and abusive Peter Capaldi. In comes the completely ineffectual Hugh Abbott (Chris Langham) as his replacement -- the most recent in a long line we are led to believe -- and off we go. It's a picture of near-total ineptitude. The business of government is to please the media, all the time under the baleful gaze of Tucker and his team of ferocious Rottweilers, and of course the 24 hour gaze of the media... forever on the lookout for stories. Useless empty policy statements, petty oneupmanship, and doing anything to please \"Number 10\", or the Chancellor at \"Number 11\" -- or rather not, since pleasing one side can bring down the wrath of the other as you are obviously part of a plot to undermine them. No, it's best just to churn out focus grouped policies that are bland enough not to upset anyone, all the while dreaming of advancement to departments that matter.It's all desperately funny and insightful. There are no bad performances. Series one and two combined add up to just six half-hour episodes in total.

Although each episode was made on a small budget when compared to the Hollywood \"A\" features of today, all of the production values of great classic movies of the golden age -- painterly composition and design, emotionally effective acting, lyrical music, suspenseful storytelling, beautiful timing, strong dramatic dialogue, elegantly choreographed action, powerful themes, colorful period costumes, folksy comic relief -- all of these values were at a consistently high level from show to show, with never an awkward effect or a misfit scene. Each of the featured characters was drawn in a unique and stylish way, suggesting the storybook characterization that distinguishes the best of the Hollywood golden age. Every one of the episodes stands well as a feature length movie in its own right and would look as good on the big screen as on TV. There's plenty of feeling, no padding or softness, and no mindless experimentation with technique or vulgarity such as has ruined so many westerns made since 1970.It's difficult to understand why an approach which succeeded for so long was abandoned in the 1970's by both television and feature film makers. Many producers turned instead in the direction indicated by spaghetti westerns. Compared to classic westerns like \"Bonanza,\" spaghetti westerns were much less lyrical and took more of a gutter eye view of the old west, stripping it of its romantic appeal and substituting what to a misguided new generation seemed a dirtier and therefore more authentic realism. In retrospect, Hollywood gave up way too much for the little that it got in return. The success of a vast body of works similar in appeal to \"Bonanza\" (including many of the other action adventure TV serials made from the '40s to the '60s) is proof that there is a widespread taste that is radically different from the one which has predominated in Hollywood since the '70s. Let's hope that one day we'll see the return of Bonanza's classic values to the screen.",

To complement rather than repeat the other reviews, a few words on how realistic it is.The multi-party negotiations are entirely plausible - that's how Danish politics works, and there are parties that switch allies from time to time. The balance between idealism and scheming is also really well done - most British and American movies and TV series portray all politicians as ruthless power-mongers, but generally politicians like to think they're doing the right thing, just like anyone else. The character are recognisable types - in particular, the far-right leader is clearly modelled on Mogens Glistrup, the entertaining, folksy and erratic founder of the current Progress Party.The series is maybe a bit weaker on the big political issues, since it has to tackle something complex in an hour, and an issue like Afghanistan can't really be analysed in any depth in that time. The episode on a thinly-veiled Sudan with the smooth, corrupt Northern leader and the plausible Southern leader with some uncomfortable views is gripping but stereotyped. But it works brilliantly with smaller issues, especially those that interweave with the private lives of the protagonists. Above all, it creates sympathetic yet flawed political figures with a non-political private life, so much more like real politicians than the one-dimensional figures that the media try to make us.",

There's no reason to EVER get that worked up over a program!  I've never been able to understand why a person would watch an entire seven year series, hating it all the way.  Option: Turn the channel.  You've got nothing to lose.  It's not like in the theater where one might sit through a tepid movie because they paid admission.  Voyager was free.  Take it or leave it.Personally, I enjoyed the show.  I liked the plot, the cast, and most of the storylines.  I appreciated the mix of drama and action.  Voyager, in my opinion, was a very good program.  Had I not felt good about it... I would have turned it off.  Problem solved.Not every series is going to be a masterpiece.  Not everyone is going to like every show.  If it's your cup of tea, drink it.  If not, put the cup down.",

Both ships are transported by a distant space probe to the Delta Quadrant, 75,000 light-years from Federation space. Voyager's crew and the Maquis form an uneasy truce to rescue crewmen of both ships, kidnapped by the probe's builder, the powerful, dying Caretaker.

    "top_review": "Lets get this out of the way straight away THIS WILL BLOW PEOPLES SOCKS OFF. Im not kidding. I know people here are attracted to this genre for various different reasons but i'd like to think we all share some connection when zombies are involved. For me its the post apocalyptic scenario. I don't particularly need the gore element but it has its place when used well.In Darabonts take on the apocalypse, you are there. The world is dead and rotting. The military have lost the battle. You wake up with Rick in this new world and get to explore it with him. Its the exposition of the pilot that will probably put the gorehounds off and lead to some small criticism from others. Personally, i want to see that. I want to know how society responded to the phenomenon. Those who have read the comic books here know that Kirkmans trick is to get you attached to the characters, like you know them intimately, then kill them off. Here Darabont uses the same trick but not how you would expect nor with who you would expect. Im personally invested in this series already. God knows what it will do to the average TV viewer. Im also not a particularly emotional person but i don't mind admitting that i was close to tears on a couple of occasions. There you go. I've said it. Just don't tell anyone. I cant say enough about Frank darabont after watching this. He understands what this genre is all about and, more importantly, he understands Romero's zombie world. The zombies are Roamers and lurkers. They act how they should and you do feel sorry for them. This is explored really well. They are a small threat but in groups all riled up and hungry. Well, you know the rest. The score is also outstanding. Very understated but poignant. The cinematography is worthy of a movie and the camera moves a lot. I cant recall any shaky cam which some people here seem to despise. Kirkman, Darabont and AMC have come up with the series we have been waiting years for. Long may it continue, and you know what? I think it will. The balance is perfect between a horror film, TV show and intelligent drama.Oh and btw. Keep getting people onboard with this. Co workers. Non zombie lover friends. Anyone. They wont think you're weird. They'll thank you. The Lost crowd are going to lap this up.",

    "top_review": "I'm very fond of Ramsay's other shows. Gordon's Kitchen Nightmares, Hell's Kitchen, Gordon's Great Escape and more. There are several issues with this series, and the most significant is that it's US made. Rather inexplicably, all the US versions of said shows are edited in the same, very American and outright dreadful way. There is no difference between episodes or even the shows in that regard. The usual Hollywood narrator quickly gets tiring, there are only a handful of repetitive sound effects which applied to the same moments throughout the show - mostly to combatants' and the judges' reactions to comments and odd behavior. To make things worse, the reactions are also the same. The result watching it is very tiring, like a visual broken record. The cuts are quick and overly dramatic, as if I'm watching a blockbuster action flick. Obviously, I'm not and while some drama is to be expected, the blatant use quickly make the show ridiculous and I feel outright stupid watching poorly seasoned tartar and undercooked chicken in such a dramatic setting. It's so bad it's insulting.The storyboard is at it's heart not too bad, but it also suffers from repetitiveness. Most of the challenges are the same, albeit set in different environments. They are also linear and not very sporadic which make them predictable. Whenever there's a freestyle cooking challenge, I expect an elimination contest and subsequently a team challenge. Repeat. Masterchef US's storytelling is like Hell's Kitchen US's short menu - scallops or elimination contests, wellington for freestyle cookings and new york strip for team challenges. Really uncooked and lacking in imagination.The people are portrayed at a fault and their personalities eschewed to create characters that provide intrigues. Some participants are always arrogant, others always cry and some are never recognized by the trio of judges, making this editing going on really easy to spot when a contestant suddenly achieves great respect and skills out of nowhere. The focus of the show is clearly on intrigues when it should be on food and chef skills. In a sense, even the characters are repetitive.Product placement is also readily apparent. The camera pans across Global knives and Viking appliances, but the most disgusting instances are frequent occurrences where Graham Elliot pitches the apparently new Masterchef pans' non-sticky surfaces. I've seen it at least three times in season two. Same pitch, same lame response from contestants. It's brutal.I have a lot of issues with this show, but there's one more minor editing problem that just boggles my mind. All the contestants always finish their dishes exactly on the clock. In each competition, Ramsay counts down and they all put their plate on the workbench exactly when the clock stopped. Every. Single. Time! This is to shake things up for the viewer of course, but to think that we're that easily fooled is offensive, just like the rest of the editing problems. Masterchef ridicules itself even further by counting down the last 5 seconds visually on a large clock face to then stop at 00:00. Problem? The units are in minutes and there is no hand for seconds. It looks amusingly stupid.All the things mentioned above are reflective of each and every episode. Watching two or more in a row is painful. In fact, watching any US remake of Ramsay's program makes for the same experience because of the ubiquitous dreadful editing.To conclude, the saddest part is that Masterchef is a great concept, executed horribly. Watching unique people of all varieties cook great food to Ramsay's socially inept personality should be a winner for all food lovers. But alas, this show isn't.",

Over-the-top characters being too positive, too negative, too macho or too weak. The scenery being too rich or too run down. The plot being too simple or too accidental. This show makes none of these mistakes.From beginning to end it feels real. Imperfect characters, no clich\u00e9s and realistic action create very enjoyable entertainment.Casting seems spot on and acting is very good. Camera-work might seem shaky at times, but I did not feel like I missed anything because of it. The action sequences kept the pace up and were choreographed quite well. The strain, exhaustion and determination of the fighters is extremely well shown.I look forward to the next episode. I gave it 8/10 because this show is focused around fighting and hence it might not be for everyone. If you enjoy boxing and mixed martial arts, it's a solid 9/10.",

I started watching Legend of the Seeker knowing that I was signing up for extreme fantasy, and must say it's very entertaining. It is a huge call to pay off a story of this scale every week without looking embarrassingly cheap, especially with all the special effects required. To the show's credit, it embraces what it is and delivers an unusually high standard for television. I find the action sequences gripping. They have put a lot of effort into stylizing the fights, and as someone who generally finds hand-to-hand a bit dull because it's all cut-cut-cut to hide inconsistencies and build pace, Legend of the Seeker has some wonderful stunt work and detailed action. The slow-mos are fantastic; it is great to see the detail and be able to understand the complexity of choreography instead of it being hidden under choppy editing.I will agree that Craig Horner is almost too pretty for this role, but it compliments the style the directors have taken; just look at the effort that's been put into delivering beautiful cinematography. It is not surprising they have chosen to cast equally beautiful leads to give the show a holistically beautiful appeal. And let there be no doubt: this show's cinematography coupled with New Zealand's breathtaking topography makes for a very pretty show.The angry and negative reactions of the book fans has been pretty overwhelming, and a bit disappointing to read. But on the bright side, this show has encouraged me to pick up the books. So it's not all lose/lose for fans of the books, as the show is garnering new readers for the novels.",

    "top_review": "There are many complaints against DragonBall GT. Many people complain about the lack of characters who get things to do, the lack of favourite characters from the first two series, and the mix of styles from the first two series. The first DragonBall was a very comedic show that centered around Goku growing up as a child, while DragonBall Z introduced many new characters, evolved the existing ones and took itself a lot more seriously. Both shows worked fine in their individual styles, but did feel slightly contrasting next to each other.DragonBall GT is also disregarded by many fans, as the series original creator did not work on this series other than having the job of character consultant.But looking past the complaints, and regarding it as a series in it's own right, DragonBall GT is very fine. The first step it takes is noticeable - reducing Goku back to the state of a child. The second is probably more noticeable - reducing the regular cast list to only 3; only two of which were favourites from DragonBall Z. In later episodes, an all new fourth party is also added - Gil, a robot who swallowed the Dragon Radar from the original series - unfortunately, he generally slows things down, but at least there has been innovation, which is commendable.What this series does - and very successfully, it's worth noting - is consistently merge the comedic DragonBall with the action-laden DragonBall Z. Everyone is a winner here, even if their favourite style is not featured as much as in their favourite of the two original series. Reducing Goku to a child was a sensible move, as it allowed fans of the original who drifted during Z's adult-Goku to become interested in the series with the character they knew and loved again. The series utilises it's license to the fullest - resurrecting Emporer Pilaf from the original series (noticeably absent from DragonBall Z), and recreating the importance of the DragonBalls (who were generally merely aesthetic in DragonBall Z). The series also introduces the character of Pan - who showed a lot of potential at the end of DragonBall Z. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the show, Pan does take up a lot of the screen time, but her character is a direct descendant of Bulma from the original series (despite family tree relations), with the role of 'growing up' given to Goku in DragonBall and Gohan in DragonBall Z.The series is not perfect, however. Early episodes are generally unengaging, with sometimes uninteresting villains and often farcical situations. The early episodes seem to focus mostly on the DragonBall style over the DragonBall Z one - and because of this the series feels alienated to those who have only experienced DBZ (which is probably a large percentage of the fanbase). Animation has dropped noticeably in quality from DragonBall Z - feeling a bit more 'clunky' and hard-edged. Character re-designs are generally awful; Vegeta starts off the series with a moustache, Gohan's glasses now dominate his face, Trunks has been given an odd suit that really can't be categorised, and Krillin is almost completely unrecogniseable from the first series.On a redeeming note, though, some character redesigns are good - Pan's costume suits the feel of the show, and Bulma looks exactly the same as in DBZ, save a few wrinkles. Goten also looks great as the skinny teenager, and his role is well written. Hercule also looks much better than expected with a bald patch.Fans of DBZ will be disappointed that many of the characters are left out of the action - Gohan, Goten and others seemingly never get to fight at all, or do anything of utmost importance. Krillin is annoyingly underused, but he was becoming like that in DragonBall Z as well. Yamcha, again, is noticeably missing. And most surprisingly, Vegeta gets considerably less screen-time in DBZ - though of all the supporting cast, he probably does the most, so it's not all bad.So what is DragonBall GT? It's a decidedly mixed bag - many good features, and many bad. But as a series in it's own right, it is very good, and a few steps above many other action animes that have all action and barely any substance. The light humour adds a lot, too, and feels very much a part of the DragonBall continuity. And because of the linked styles from the first two series, which works very well in the later episodes, the series really does take on a new perspective, and truly does feel like a DragonBall series. It's not perfect, but for fans of the series it's more of the same - repetitive fight after repetitive fight, with Hercule throwing in some overused (but still welcome) cameos here and there.A good follow up, if not perfect. Definitely worth investing in if a fan of either original series - or if DBZ left you begging for more - which it did for many people.",

Three years after its conclusion 'Alias' still remains my favorite show, thanks to a stellar cast, gripping score, intelligent writers and great production values; with the lovely Jennifer Garner being the glue that holds it all together, and of course, the brainchild behind it all, J.J.

I was leery at first from the commercials, but after watching the first episode I could not stop laughing the whole time. Very low energy humor but just incredibly funny in the situations. The conversations are too awkward and ridiculous not to be funny. I showed it to many friends who also loved it. So far this might be the funniest new show on TV. Despite the ridiculousness, some of the ideas are actually pretty good in their own right. I think this show is pretty original, and a great parody of the business marketing TV shows. This is something I personally have been waiting for, its simple, clever, and a satirical comment about American business culture, but with genuine brilliance behind the hilarity. I think Nathan is a genius, and I really hope this show doesn't get canceled like another comment said. I would love to see it continue, but comedy central does love their one season hilarious shows. Hopefully they learn early on that this is a great one and keep it going. The world needs more Nathan.",

Miss Applegate has progressed quite a bit as a comedic actress over the years, and her character here gets a chance to show her considerable comedic talents.

Anyway, I won't go on and on here, but I feel compelled to say something about this show because with its perfect blend of comedy, drama, action, and romance, (with no aspect of either feeling forced just for the sake of having it), it is quite simply one of the best animes ever made. Ask a few anime fans to list some of their favorite shows and you'll start to hear quite a few of the greats being repeated. This show easily stands shoulder to shoulder with any and all of them.To give a little idea of the overall feel of this show for the anime fans out there. Let's say you hold, \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", in one hand and, \"FLCL\", in the other. Now put your hands together and you've got Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.Epic is probably the single best word to describe this show; epic in both scope and scale. From the technical aspects of the truly incredible, fluid and stylish animation; to the story with it's take on humanity, evolution and the potential finish lines to which we're sprinting; to the battles, ranging from underground guerrilla warfare in the early stages and ultimately culminating in a climactic finale of truly galactic proportions. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say it involves literally tossing whole planets like baseballs and even flinging entire galaxies like so many shuriken. Epic.Nothing is perfect though, it does stumble a bit in the audio department. However, it only falls short in comparison to the rest of itself. That is to say, while the rest of the show is, \"excellent\", some of the audio aspects are only, \"very good\". The character designs are also nothing special, but that is easily countered by the spectacular animation and the personalities of the characters themselves.It's probably not for everyone. Some may be put off by the artistic styling such as the unconventional and often bizarre angles and techniques as well as the hyperkinetic feel of the animation. I, for one, couldn't be more thrilled with all of it. I've seen a lot of anime and quite frankly most of it is mediocre at best. After wading through so many anime lately with virtually interchangeable story lines, art and characters, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is like a breath of fresh air.Sorry, I guess I did kind of go on and on after all. Anyway...9.5 out of 10, but since IMDb doesn't allow the .5, I'll have to round it up and give my first ever 10.",

Let me say uncandidly my wife and I both deal with weight problems, and for the first time I felt the issues were centered without being insulting. The jokes are \"laugh with me\" style rather then \"laugh at me\". Needless to say, dealing with these issues can make a person self conscious, and we see that portrayed in Mike as he is smitten with Molly (and I can certainly see why) but hesitates to make the move to ask her out.Katy Mixon and the always delightful Swoosie Kurtz make a fantastic addition as Molly's family, and the references to her late father where we learn the genetic connection to her weight issues. The ultra thin pair eating a huge piece of cake in front of an exercising Molly is a great demonstration of how fighting weight isn't always the same issue for 2 different people.As a matter of fact, it is refreshing to see Mike and Molly both trying to take their weight seriously with the participation in Overeaters Annoymous...and Mike announces his loss of 3 pounds, putting perfect perception into how the battle for weight loss is just that, and without a sense of being preachy for those that may be in the same battles.I also was pleased with an entertaining performance by Reno Wilson as Mike's partner on the police force. He joked with his friend about his weight, but you could tell it was done with love...not shying away from some of his own relationship issues that I am sure we will soon see expounded. And even with the friendship in the jokes, he also proves to be a real friend in general to Mike.I hope \"Mike and Molly\" lasts and continues to follow the lead of the pilot and keep things in the proper perspective. Don't shy from the weigthty problems of protagonists without becoming a holier then though preachy \"you better deal with your weight\" attitude. As a fan of Chuck Lorre's previous efforts, I am sure we are in for another treat.",

I always liked Elfman from her \"Dharma and Greg\" days plus I've admired her sex appeal from certain film roles. Jenna plays Billie a mid to late 30's single woman who lives in the city by the bay San Francisco, CA. And Billie is a successful film movie review critic for a local newspaper however she's just broken up from her older and happens to be boss boyfriend James(\"Melrose Place's \" Grant Show). So then Billie fishes the waters and she hooks with a young and hot boy toy Zack(Jon Foster) who's somewhat of a young slacker type she certainly robbed the cradle, however her pleasing night of unprotected passion leads to an unplanned pregnancy and strange roommate relationship with Zack. Along the way this relationship is challenging and trying as each are friends, yet they are exploring the fields with other people the jokes and one liners of this show may seem repetitive yet I find them witty and crude with sexual humor. As clearly the angles of sexual frustration is felt in Zack and Billie's relationship. And good supporting turns are given from Ashley Jensen as Billie's elegant and sexy female friend Oliva and it's funny and somewhat of a pain to watch Lennon Parham as Billie's comical and mentally challenged lonely sister Abby. Overall this show may not be a mainstay, still I like it as it's blended with enough sexy humor and wit to make any comedy fan watch. And it's a real treat for any Jenna fans to watch as it's nice to see the cute and attractive Elfman back working on TV.",

    "top_review": "Despite the fact that all three of the CSI franchise shows exaggerate the roles and scope of crime scene investigators, I enjoy them in varying degrees. As a retired cop, I've worked with CSIs on cases many times. They are mostly good, solid professionals who do their previously unsung job and help detectives solve cases. The CSIs on the CBS shows do far more than that and far more than they would be allowed to do in real police departments. I'll suspend disbelief and allow the wide dramatic license when I enjoy a TV show.All of that aside, I was looking forward to CSI:NY for a variety of reasons, not the least its being set in my other home town. It also boasted Gary Sinise, a great actor, in the lead role. I think I still prefer William Peterson's Grissom, but Sinise as Mac Taylor is so far above Caruso as Cain that comparisons are hard to make. Yes, he is somewhat cold, but in police work it is rare to see someone who wears his heart on his sleeve. Cold professionalism is the hallmark of most cops. Add to that the loss of his wife in the tragedy of 9/11 -- which I do not think the show exploits; it is a legitimate plot point in the development of a character in NY and motivates Taylor to find justice wherever he can, something his wife was denied -- and his quiet demeanor makes sense.If Emily Proctor leaves CSI:Miami, I'll quit watching. That will leave the original and this gritty, dark spin-off. With CSI:NY on hand, I won't miss Miami for a moment.I just watched the season finale and am looking forward to next season. I agree that the spate of spin-offs shows a lack of creativity, but when it is done well -- as it is in CSI:NY and in Law and Order: SVU and Law and Order: Trial by Jury -- it can be good viewing. (I'd like to add Law and Order,: Criminal Intent -- I like D'Onofrio a lot -- but I just couldn't get into the show, try as I might.)With the loss this year of both Third Watch and NYPD Blue, we are left with only a couple of good cops and robbers shows.

Get the picture?Quite simply, if you have ever liked a TV show at all, you will be hooked.LOST is a show about a plane crash on a mysterious island. 48 people survive, but the show centers around 14, all with secrets. At first, there is confusion. But as the show goes on, friendships develop, and we learn that there is more to the island than what it seems...The characters are fantastic--don't pay any attention to those who say the cast is so diverse it is clich\u00e9d, those are probably the same people who would have criticized it if it was all white.In short, watch.

How else could you explain the daunting premise of setting such a classic struggle of good vs. evil, in the bleak, Depression-ravaged setting of the Oklahoma dust bowl, circa 1930's?It's a good sign that wherever the overall story arc is going, it was engaging enough to attract some top notch talent, from both mainstream features and more edgy, independent fare. TERMINATOR 3's Nick Stahl and HIGHLANDER and BUCKAROO BANZAI cult fave Clancy Brown face off as a poor dirt farmer and a charismatic preacher, respectively, both of whom seem to possess extraordinary supernatural gifts that neither understands, nor has the power to completely control. One is a \"creature of light,\" while the other is a \"creature of darkness,\" as intoned in the opening monologue by carny boss Michael J. Anderson, (of \"Twin Peaks\" fame, cementing the Lynchian vibe). The fact that the identity of each is never clearly or inanely foreshadowed or telegraphed to the audience, is one of \"Carnivale's\" many compelling hooks.Add to the mix the usual collection of sideshow oddities, portrayed more than ably by some interesting actors: internationally renowned actor Patrick Bachau as Professor Lodz, the \"blind\" clairvoyant; Clea DuVall (IDENTITY and THE FACULTY) as Sophie, the tarot card reader with a telepathic yet comatose mother; Tim DeKay (BIG EDEN) as the boss' right hand man and Sophie's \"love interest.\" And yes, there's a set of cojoined twins, a bearded lady, a tattooed \"monkey man\" with a tail (if that's what he is.) Even genre staple Adrienne Barbeau gets into the act as the mother of the strongman, (and if the previews are any indication, her part in all of this gets MUCH bigger later on.)We even get the shamefully underused and underrated John Savage, in some mysterious and creepy flashbacks that seem to combine visions that would have not been out of place in any of Ken Russell's films, (particularly TOMMY or ALTERED STATES.)This is the kind of television that TV rarely does anymore, dark, gritty, disturbingly inventive. No wonder the networks are slowly dying, since cable is quickly becoming a safe haven for filmmakers who dare to take the kinds of risks that make their audiences think \"outside the box.\"I only hope that \"Carnivale\" will continue to sustain and build upon the premise and the promise it presents in the first episode.",

That's what happened to me with 'Banshee'.It's amazing this show hasn't found a bigger audience. It has its fans, sure, but as far as the amount of steady viewers is concerned, it's nowhere near playing in the big leagues \u0096 yet. When I started to watch the first episode, I expected a decent, but low budget 'neo-noir' crime show with some sexy women and a few good shoot-outs. What I got instead is high-octane pulp cinema that gets your heart pumpin' with adrenalin from the first second, and an opening chase/shoot-out that wouldn't have to hide behind any mega-budget action production Hollywood has churned out recently.Needless to say, I was hooked. This show is raw, gritty, brutal and over-the-top; it's got everything most action films lack these days \u0096 and it's absolutely NOT PG-13. Granted, it's pulpy, trashy, sometimes even down-right ridiculous \u0096 but I loved every minute of it so far. The production values are among the best I've seen on TV and the cast is fantastic.

Like Fridtjof S\u00e5heim and Trond Fausa Aurvaag, both well respected actors in Norway. The level of acting is good overall, with characters that brings the best and worse out of each other. I'm looking forward to the continuation, and I recommend others to see it too.",

Though it came after Remington Steele, which I believe was the far more excellent show consistently, Moonlighting got all the buzz and the excitement. Most of this was due to the breakout performance of Bruce Willis, who, of course, became a megastar thanks to Moonlighting. I can still see him facing a criminal while singing \"My Girl\" and then indicating with his hands when the goon should come in with the high part. It was touches like this that made Moonlighting special.Willis and co-star Cybill Shepherd were fabulous and had excellent chemistry. They were ably supported by Allyce Beasley, Curtis Armstrong, Charles Rocket (a brilliant choice for David's brother, who appeared in some episodes), and for several episodes, Eva Marie Saint and the late Robert Webber as Maddie's parents.The series boasts some phenomenal episodes but when it fell, it fell hard. Ego problems, budget problems, and story direction problems began to weigh it down, and it finally crawled to an end after tons of reruns being shown in prime time when scripts were unable to be delivered. However, the heights hit in the first two seasons or so are unmatched probably by any other series for their creativity and brilliance. Moonlighting remains a wonderful and joyous part of TV history.",

Being a hopeless anime fan, everything coming from other countries from Japan usually seems too flat and boring for me. But the Teen Titans -are- different. Yes, they did use a lot of typical anime effects in that cartoon (huge surprised eyes, sweat drops etc etc) but that's what makes the show so great, adding it some depth and detail.And the characters. Each of them is a unique personality. Always having these typical everyday quarrels, they still manage to work as a team when it comes to saving the world and that happens a lot.Robin: probably even my least favorite character. Always with the \"Titans, trouble!\", being the boss and having the identity crisis about him being a bit like Slade. But hey, someone has to lead that bunch, otherwise there'd be too much video games and a lot less saving the world.Starfire: the naive, funny, yet very powerful one. She may seem like an airhead but actually she just doesn't mix well with Earth's customs.Cyborg: all superhero teams must have someone who takes care of all the electronic gadgets. Heck, Cy -is- an electronic gadget...Raven: actually the most powerful of the Titans. All episodes that have focused on her clearly show that she could easily destroy the whole world if she wanted to. Could Robin do that? Or Cyborg or Beastboy? Don't think so. But being able to control her powers and despite being so much different than the rest, still fitting in and fighting by their side, she's definitely my favorite character.Beastboy: kinda misunderstood, but the show would be a lot more boring without him. Honestly, he's the main joker in the gang (and Raven with her constant sarcasm is up next).In short: thumbs up. 10/10",

After all, WHY would I want to watch a show, and a comedy at that, based upon a concept that has left me jobless. I have to be honest; I was hoping that the employees would be foolish, cultural stereotypes, and therefore I would have an excuse to poke fun at them. So I sat back, got my generic snacks and soda ready (can't afford the name brand stuff anymore) and prepared myself for a chance at cultural ridicule. But a funny thing happened; about 10 minutes in....I laughed! Not at the locals naive concept at American excesses, NOT at their reverence of all things beef-related, NOT at their stereotypical accents (actually in THEIR country the American had the accent) but because I heard something funny. So I put my pride in my pocket and started to watch this show as though I was interested in what I was watching. Then I realized something; just because someone is naive doesn't make them stupid or deserving of ridicule. What I ALSO realized was that these characters were just like me...wanting a job so they could pay their bills, put food on their table and a roof over their heads. And even though the locals were naive and kind of goofy in a sweet way I found myself caring about them. For example, the young girl who barely speaks above a whisper; THIS is a job for someone like her? Of course not. But her character was so innocent and so sweet and wouldn't give up I was rooting for her to succeed. The guy who couldn't stop talking...we ALL know someone like that but he wasn't obnoxious, probably just lonely and haven't we ALL been there? The American manager who was sent to India to head this rag-tag group could have been written as a cruel SOB but he wasn't. Their success was HIS success and he goes above and beyond to see that his employees succeed so he could secure his own position and contribute to the company's bottom line (without being a creep in the process). These are likable, well conceived and well acted characters and guess what...the show is funny.

    "top_review": "An enthusiastic reviewer started writing about this show when it started filming, speaking with great anticipation about the creator of the show's previous work and then the premise of his new show - a crime story, inherently tragic, focusing on grief, dark puzzles and a small community in which everyone knows everyone. I immediately thought of 'The Killing' and then, if it would give me the same feeling of despondency I seem to get, whenever watching shows like that.Turns out I was both right and completely wrong. And I'll get to the emphatic 'yes!' for this show in a moment. The storyline, like in most crime shows these days, is hardly original. And you could say that like many British TV shows with veteran actors, intriguing plots with a dark narrative devoid of hope or a happy ending (contrary to most American TV shows with a similar premise), this show too, relies on intriguing characters to keep your interest in the puzzle and the secrets each character holds. But Broadchurch does all that without ever indulging in tragedy or hopelessness. No easy feat.The acting and casting are flawless. The story feels real and unfolds with a steady, organic pace. David Tennant's nuanced take on the character, which could have easily been another self-important anti-hero with a troubled past, instead offsets Olivia Colman's character wonderfully. Her genuine, sincere approach to life, creating inevitable friction is a surprisingly fresh take on the traditional mismatched police partner or 'buddy cop' dynamics.And then comes the beauty. Each shot framed like a painting featuring the stunning cliffs and beaches around the Dorset coast in all its rugged glory. Even interviews with suspects are photographed with elegance and an unexpected ethereal quality, using blurred light and colors. The stunning landscape setting is used not just as a backdrop, but a powerful narrative, contrasting its vastness with the small stories of each one of the locals. The calm, reflective moments in each episode feature scenes without dialog, allowing you to absorb it all.This is where the music comes in. Too often an afterthought, a necessary element to invoke emotion or underline the words, here the music becomes one of the main characters of the show. An understated yet stunning soundtrack by \u00d3lafur Arnalds, featured prominently throughout the series. And what a revelation it is. Allowing you to watch Broadchurch both as a sophisticated detective story and as an evocative, elegant music video. And while concert halls featured the most talented composers in the past, sadly or thankfully, TV shows (possibly more than feature length films even), seem to be the perfect outlet for the most creative contemporary artists. Utopia, Breaking Bad and Battlestar Galactica come to mind.You could say then, that it is \u00d3lafur Arnalds' score who helps Broadchurch transcend the sadness and grief of the story told, but it wouldn't be fair to understate the the stunning cinematography and art direction, subtle and powerful storytelling and production by Chris Chibnall. And with a cast that is able to portray the characters with depth and authenticity, it helps Broadchurch stand out from similar shows, deserving a review beyond simple comparison.",

HMIA is about the big city life, it's about the Big Apple, about young people trying to achieve something. It's more \"down to earth\" than Entourage and not as spectacular at first. The pacing is much slower and you have less sex, models and rock'n roll. But you DO have a great cast, authentic people in the most realistic capture of young adults living in Manhattan. It's a love letter to the city and the people who live there. It's a great show with likable characters, great dialogue, great cinematography and good and witty humor.

    "critic_rating": "8.8", 
    "top_review": "This forth and final series is perhaps the best of all the Black Adder episodes; it is also more of a tragi-comedy than just plain old slapstick perhaps because at the time (1989) the events of WW1 were very much in the minds of a lot of people, whether it be surviving soldiers or relatives.As such there was some controversy when it was first broadcast by the BBC for its apparent lack of respect to those who fought and lost their lives for the sake of freedom & democracy.However, in retrospect, this isn't strictly true because even with Episode One there is a tangible shift in tone from previous Black Adder series. Yes some of the slapstick tomfoolery is still there, mainly at the expense of poor gormless Private Baldrick. But in addition a lot of the supposedly funny lines do have quite serious undertones, and bely the real truth of the sheer lunacy & farce that went on during the real war.For those that know their 20th Century history, WW1 was seen as a complete disaster for all and sundry, especially for the British soldiers in the trenches, primarily because they were being commanded & told how to fight a war by the most repulsive upper-class morons that call themselves Generals that ever wore a uniform.This was plainly represented by the bumbling fool, General Melchett (a wonderfully bemusing performance from Stephen Fry). Melchett simply has no idea of what life really is like for the troops on the front-line while he prattles on 35 miles behind the front-line in some safe palatial mansion where the most dangerous hazard to his life is whether he can unscrew a cork out of a champagne bottle without it hitting him in the face.Melchett is a complete buffoon but only Captain Blackadder realises this; everyone else thinks the General knows what he is doing purely because of his rank & social standing. So it is no wonder that Blackadder wants to mutiny because it's a hard choice deciding who the real enemy is - the Germans or his own Generals. For example:-General Melchett: Are you looking forward to the big push?Private Baldrick: No sir, I'm absolutely terrified.General Melchett: The healthy humour of the honest, Tommy. Don't worry my boy, if you should falter, remember that Captain Darling and I are behind you.Edmund Blackadder: About thirty-five miles behind you.This dark humour is wonderfully interwoven with the usual witty lines thanks largely to the writers, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton. It is typically anti-war but with good reason, as Blackadder declares in one episode:-\"with 50,000 men being killed every week who is going to miss one dead pigeon!\"The madness of this war also draws our attention to those very same front-line troops such as Blackadder, Baldrick & Lieutenant George. Their living conditions are disgusting & the fear of being shot or bombed out of their trench a very real possibility.The humour is just an adjunct to the real horrors that are going on in their lives, and this is beautifully concluded in the very sad finale. No longer did the critics argue this series lacked any respect because come the final few minutes of Episode Six we were treated to the sad demise of all those soldiers fading into time and replaced by the infamous poppy fields that strewn Northern France.Blackadder Goes Forth is far more intelligent than a lot of sitcoms; the writing and acting is exceptionally good, and also underpins the true human sacrifice the millions of soldiers gave to their King & country while the smug & arrogant Generals went home to more medals, honours and riches than ever before.School children of today find reading about history boring & not very relevant. But thanks to this series I am sure young & old alike will find this far more interesting, absorbing, damming & shocking than any written word on the subject could ever say.War Is Hell!****/*****",

Of course, having a hologram from his own time (Al) guiding him on his adventures was another key component to the show.One complaint I've always heard about the show is: if Sam puts right what once went wrong, wouldn't he be altering the future? The answer is no. Sam doesn't leap into anyone famous (often) and so he would not be altering the future dramatically for many. And whenever he does leap into someone famous, everything works out the way history recorded it.NBC made a huge blunder cancelling this series, especially cancelling it on a cliff hanger. And why won't Universal make a movie? Fans want it and Don Bellisario has expressed an interest in doing one. So come on. Put what right what NBC did wrong and make a movie.",

    "critic_rating": "6.2", 
    "top_review": "First off, let me say that I have read the original novel and seen the 1979 miniseries. Both are great in their own right. The novel is scary and foreboding. The '79 movie captures that feeling even though it changed a good amount of the story.This 2004 adaptation doesn't attempt to mimic the feelings the '79 movie conveyed. In my opinion, this is a good thing. Although many posters seem to indicate they want to see the same scenes that were in the '79 version, what would this accomplish? The '79 version is on tape, so if you want to be scared in the same way, watch that.The critics I've read so far have criticized this film for not being close to the novel. I guess I had a different expectation. I have long since given up on the expectation that novels translate perfectly to film. This does not happen (the rare exception being Lord of the Rings, yet even that had changes). Nevertheless, here are their main arguments. I'll respond to each one:1) The ending of Father Callahan. - This is a 3 hour movie, and as such, plot points and characters need to be wrapped up. While Father Callahan may survive in the novel (only to reappear in The Dark Tower), this would leave more questions than answers to those who are watching the miniseries and getting the story for the first time. Remember how ridiculous the truncated version of the '79 movie ended--without knowing what happened to Susan? Films need to wrap up their loose ends.2) The modernization of the story. - Salem's Lot was set in the mid-seventies not for any particular reason but only because that was when King wrote it. Obviously the original film took place in the seventies (as it was shown in 1979). Why must the new miniseries take place in the 70s? There's nothing in the book that requires the 70s to be the setting, and more people will be able to adapt to the current time. They don't sacrifice any of the story elements to do this. But since we are modernizing it, we do need to add some modern touches (i.e. email, cell phone, etc.) None of these take away from the story.3) It's not scary / doesn't scare me as much as the '79 version. - Again, the '04 version isn't attempting to imitate the earlier film, and rightfully so. We don't need a shot by shot of what made the '79 classic horror (and it is) - this is how the remake of \"Psycho\" got panned. The original is a classic, and you can't remake a classic. So instead the director here (Saloman) decided to focus not so much on the fear but on another aspect of King's novel that was not focused on in the '79 version, and that is the entity of the town itself. The '79 version eliminated, combined, and truncated many characters, so that in the end, the only really main ones were Ben, Mark, Susan, and Straker. It worked, but this was a far cry from King's novel. The 2004 version gives us much more, including Dr. Cody, Dud, Ruthie, Father Callahan (in a larger role), Barlow (in the real role), and many other minor characters (i.e. the bus driver).To sum up - No, it's not scary, but it isn't trying to be. There's a '79 version that did that very, very well. We didn't need them to remake that; it's good on its own. What we needed was an interesting story. Salem's Lot '04 gives us that. Don't expect it to win any Emmys, but hearing people say they wasted 4 hours of their lives makes me laugh. This is one of the best adaptations of a King work, and there are far, far worse.",

    "top_review": "I thought that the story of an arrogant top-flight London surgeon trying to run a practice in a chummy town in Cornwall would make for a one-note fish-out-of-water series, but instead it has been a delight every week. Doctor Martin Ellingham, for a reason that will be revealed later in the series, decides to transplant himself to a seaside village in Cornwall where he spent a few summers as a child with an aunt, who presently runs an organic farm there. Being a terse, intensely closed, firmly impersonal fellow, he is appalled at the ways of the village people who consider themselves as one big, happy, nosy family. Of course, in a series like this, we expected the clash of cultures between the coldly efficient doctor and the quirky little town to be the main storyline, but it is the diversity of their quirkiness (some of which will surprise you!) and the inventive medical cases that call the doctor's attention, and the personal incidents that test his patience, that will keep you coming back for more each week. While there is a lead cast -- Doctor Ellingham (who intensely dislikes the too familiar \"Doc Martin\" that people insist on calling him), the head schoolteacher who develops an interest in him, despite herself, the affable teddy bear of a police constable, the exasperating receptionist with a chip on her shoulder, and the jokey, prank-loving plumber played by the wonderful Ian McNeice -- none of the characters that show up fleetingly in the beginning is actually a one-off. Eventually, everyone's back story is brought to the fore. This makes the town more and more three-dimensional and you may find yourself caring quite a lot for the individuals that make up this engaging little village; yes, even for the irascible doctor, whose own back story is rather quite poignant and makes his unbending personality more understandable. The best thing about the series is that it accomplishes all this without the schmaltz that usually ruins programs of this genre. For intelligent, humorous and charming entertainment, spend an hour in the village by the sea of Doc Martin. Who knows? Maybe someday, people will be trying to find Portwenn in the same way that fans of veterinarian-writer James Herriot have been looking for his fictional Darrowby. I would certainly give it a try.",

He grew up in the area having been raised by his now widowed Aunt Joan Norton. His reasons for leaving London and the high-paid life of a consultant are not clear initially but related to a phobia he has recently developed. He soon meets several of the locals and eccentricity abounds. Martin's situation is made more difficult by what can only be referred as an almost complete lack of an acceptable bedside manner. He is gruff, abrupt and intolerant, not only in issues related to medicine, but to life in general. He and the headmistress of the local school, Louisa Glasson, are clearly attracted to each other and despite their awkwardness, slowly develop a relationship.",

    "top_review": "OK, first things first - these TV series are Bulgarian. This is very important, since, even if at some point you are able to find a localized (translated) version, maybe you will understand the plot, but won't be able to feel the movie and re-live (some) of the story. Unless you come from a post-communist Eastern Bloc country.The plot is a classical gangster action-drama, similar to \"The Godfather\" or \"Brigada\". It features nice, realistic, almost fully believable characters - actually, most of the Bulgarians can easily recognize someone they know in the movie characters: Be it the mighty, well-connected boss; or his spectacularly sexy wife; or his lieutenants, fit with the appropriate black SUVs; or maybe the cops, filled with hatred for the world they can't understand. The series don't lack action - on the contrary - in every episode there is some eye-candy: for example a hot pursuit or gun-fight. Not too much, but still enough to take you out of the theater-style in-room-only dialog drama. Actually I love the way it was shot - combined with the intriguing plot it can be considered the best Bulgarian-made production ever.The only downside of the series is the persistent desire of Bulgarian actors to over-do and over-act and over-pronounce. Especially if compared to a Hollywood-style counterpart, the differences in the acting are just annoying. For example, all the characters use excessively heavy grammar structures and just so perfectly correct pronunciation, even in the most intimate or action-filled parts - which might be applicable to the 8 o'clock news, but simply destroys the credibility of the scene. Leaves you thinking about the bad acting, not the story, not the plot, not the intrigue. This is such a major fault for me, that the movie would get 6/10 if it wasn't Bulgarian. That is some kind of chauvinism - but I believe the otherwise almost flawless \"\u041f\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435\"'s creators should be encouraged to keep up the lovely work.All in all, if you are Bulgarian, you are going to love it.

There are some traditional American values on display here and to some that may seem not so modern or inappropriate, but in all honesty (am not an American nor can relate to this through experience), it is better than watching other comedy shows that are ridiculous, not funny at all and mainly promote specific themes to make sure they appeal to the wider audience.

Each episode stands alone from the rest and often the only common denominators in the stories are the presence of Ginko, the main character, and occasional appearances of his friend, Adashino-sensei. Ginko is a Mushi-shi (or bug master, if you'd prefer a literal translation) who travels around the far reaches of Japan examining and documenting various species of mushi. At the same time he helps those who come into contact with these entities: it seems many types of mushi are parasitic in nature and there are unfavorable results when they cross paths with humans. Throughout the series we're shown many magnificent creatures as well as a few intriguing glimpses into Ginko's past.Mushishi is an extraordinary series. It was refreshing in that it was so serene to watch \u0096 the art is beautiful, the atmosphere is peaceful, and yet the series was able to create excellent tension when it was called for. The stories within it are intriguing and one is left with a sense of wonderment when all is said and done.However, I was left yearning for more from the series. I found myself so interested in the characters that I wished for more plot \u0096 perhaps an arc or two that consisted of multiple episodes. There were a few opportunities in the show where they could have done just that, but instead they chose to remain true to the manga. As a result, you have to be patient while watching the series and enjoy it for what it is; its pacing is so different from other animes that you might be more familiar with.This series has easily become one of my favorites, and I hope it receives more recognition outside of Japan \u0096 recognition that it so plainly deserves.9/10",

The vice city sketch, John Mayer in the Harlem barber shop, the player haters ball, the real world with one super white guy, I know black people, and of course the racial draft...You just got to take all the skits' racism out of context (The way I think Chapelle does), and just laugh at yourself and your entire race for once instead of hyper-defending your race.

    "top_review": "..And that's maybe not the worst yet! I love soap operas. Who can forget (Knots Landing) or (Falcon Crest)? But when some goods outlive for more than their competence; they transform into envenomed! At first, it was another, late 80s, so TV-ish, daytime soap. Namely sexy, melodramatic and yeah.. boring! But after that, it turned \u0096 while keeping itself outwardly glossy \u0096 into ugly huge farce.I can't say it's a diary of a family. I can't say it's a thrilling melodrama. I just can say that it's a living exploitation of soap. And you know what? It's successful. Very successful indeed ! (The Bold and the Beautiful), after 22 years and counting, is a real fine example of the kind of drama which some viewers need everyday like a requisite meal to satisfy their hanger (for living a romance, feeling rich, beating enemies..) whatever the acting was, and whatever the manipulation is.I somewhat caught on its formula : a sexual desire, a sinful love, a separation between 2 lovers, a wicked plot and a surprise. Then another round. Then another one. Then another with other characters, with new characters, then between the old and new characters, then between them and us maybe!, then the same formula again with the same characters afresh, going on and on till the end of you, days or its time on screen (namely : its cancellation !). It's a perfect scheme. So loved and long-lived. But who can stand endless story lines, everlasting dialog, the silence of the actors before cutting to another scene or commercials, and \u0096 most of all \u0096 the changing of partners?? Whoever can stand all of this, for more than 5500 episodes, I'm surely not one of them. Why is that ? Because I don't have non-critic mentality, a desperate passion for melodrama, and that PATIENCE!Speaking about the changing of partners thing, I recall a line was said by (Dean Stockwell), in one of (Quantum Leap)'s episodes, talking about a soap opera \"Here Sam, everybody is sleeping with everybody\". (B & B) maybe broke this rule since in it everybody slept, sleeps, and will sleep with everybody! Sometimes I think that they have nothing to do in this world but sleeping with each other, then chatter and chatter and chatter, to re-sleep again yet with others. It's not the story of life, it's the life of very profitable story! I know that it got the power to make you sleep in front of it too! Did its success become a curse ?! I don't completely think so. Not for the actors since they're all well-paid. Not for the viewers since they get what they want. But maybe for the writers. These people got to write one work for over than 2 decades ?? OH MY GOD! This is, in spite of all the money in the world, so heavy mission to be done. So, based on my compassion, I'll forgive them for such events like the one of my title's line which was the first thing I heard when I tried to continue watching this series again after years of losing any interest in it (yes, first I felt panic, thinking that the mom slept with her own son, but I understood it right later!). Hence when things reach this far.. I invite you to do what I already did : Changing the Channel. Believe me.. You'll feel so bold and beautiful after!In the next episodes, I bet you.. the son will turn out to the real father of his sister, (Ridge) will turn out to be a brother of his mother, (Eric Forrester) will have a sex change operation, (Brooke) will turn into lesbian (if she didn't yet?!), and I can see the end right now; the aliens will take them all away (it kind of happened before, didn't it?!). And for that I'll salute the creative writers. Simply, what can a teleplay writer do\u0085More ?!!! Originally, as much the viewers want it, as much it gains more time on air, and so\u0085that's what has to happen. Nevertheless, it triumphed over any jesting, even its own, being the most-watched soap in the world, with an audience of an estimated 26.2 million viewers in more than 110 nations. So while I believe that it is provoking sitcom; running without laughing tracks or laughing.. Others don't, and that's in fact what makes it provoking. But everybody got their own classics. This show is classic for some. Classic crap for others. Heck, it is classic both ways!",

I know, its a broad generalisation, but the world of commercialism has taken over children's programs, and while I still enjoy cartoons, I can only feel free from the 'buy this' and 'you must have this' craze when I watch ABC TV (no commercials).This cartoon impacted on my life a lot when I was younger. It made me really care about the environment; not just the cute ponies and flowers, but for every environmental issue that came up on the TV or in the newspaper. I wanted to take on the world. But back then, there really wasn't a lot of support. There were organisations that supported things like 'Clean up Australia Day', but there was little community or family support for my ideals and as I grew older, I became disillusioned that I could ever make a difference on my own. And when I reached High School, we were taught about the environment and biology, and I didn't care anymore about the dying world around me. I think we need to have 'important' cartoons like 'Captain Planet' back, because when I was impressionable and making up my own identity during my teenage years, it wasn't there for me and remains only a memory of when I was a little girl. In any case, its a pity that people today can't try to make something 'worthwhile' to show the kids, to gently expose them to what the world really *is*. If its for the money, why can't they advertise and sell to kids the idea that environmentalism is 'cool' and needed? I mean, its better that telling kids to buy dolls with plastic clothes, in my opinion.",

    "top_review": "First of all I would like to begin by stating that I actually enjoyed Terminator 3. I know that there are a lot of haters out there but I do not count myself as one of them. I enjoyed the movie for what it was. However, as a die-hard Terminator fan I believe \"enjoyable\" is an underachievement for a franchise as great as the Terminator series. Terminators 1 and 2 were classics, and the third instalment fell a little short.The Sarah Connor Chronicles however evokes a feeling which was strangely lacking in T3. Excitement. The idea of ignoring the events of the third movie, which this series seems to be running with, seems a wise move. I enjoyed every moment of the pilot immensely.Although a little sceptical before I watched the pilot, Lena Headey and Thomas Dekker are cast well as Sarah and John Connor. Initially I didn't believe either had the right look or attitude to play characters portrayed so well by Linda Hamilton and a young Edward Furlong. However I was gladly mistaken. Headly does Sarah Conner almost as well as Hamilton, a high praise if there ever was one, and Dekker plays the reluctant leader with credibility. I see both actors growing into their roles more with each new episode. The main highlight in my opinion was Summer Glau in her role as Cameron. She portrays her character with a grace and beautifully understated performance which is refreshing, and more believable and engaging than Kristanna Loken's performance in T3.All and all, the pilot was a great beginning to the series with some nice surprises and a lot of action. It may have a few teething problems as all new shows do, but with a little bit of polish before it airs it will be a very strong beginning of a new journey for this classic franchise. Lets hope Fox shows some common sense for once and holds onto this one.",

These two come up with rad skits in which they play Hippy Vegans, Cult members, Cos Play characters, and Yuppies just to name a few. Every episode contains famous actors, which add to the fun!!Port goes stageless! SNL, and Kids in The Hall take place on stages or sets. Port does not. This gives it a more authentic reality show feel which makes it more accessible and less artificial.This show makes me feel like I know these people or grew up with them. They make fun of things me and my friends make fun of. Everyday young adults, who understand punk, politics, indie rock, college life, and getting over all of that will relate. Portlandia is a 9 1/2 star show yet it's not over the top. It's not pretentious. This is why Port is for now. This generation. It's almost like a consistently funny SNL. An SNL that doesn't make fun of pop culture but rather everyday life. Therefore it's easy to laugh at again and again.Though it's great Port lacks just little in two areas rewatchability and characters. If they could just some more stable characters and focus a little bit more on consistent relationships (non sketch stuff) to give the audience something to look forward to than maybe next season it will be a 10.",

    "title": "Black Lagoon", 
    "critic_rating": "8.1", 
    "top_review": "A creation of eastern production team Madhouse and American Geneon from an original graphic novel by Rei Hiroe, this is an adult-aimed anime series which turns out well above average, even if not quite on the consistent level as such standalone Madhouse features as Millennium Actress (2001), or Tokyo Godfathers (2003).Much of the particular flavour and interesting tensions within Black Lagoon can be put down to its split production origins, a dichotomy also reflected in dramatis personnel. Besides Dutch there's a Jewish-American (Benny) and Chinese-American (Revy), as well as Rock's Japanese presence. At the same time, set pieces familiar from American action cinema jostle for screen time with characterisation and some graphic styling typical of homegrown manga. As the varied team undertake a series of assignments (at least in First Barrage, the name of the series' initial half, reviewed here), it gradually leads to an escalating tension between Rock and Revy. The new recruit, out of the boardroom and now onboard, so to speak, seeks to establish himself in a new and bewildering world, where he has a chance of gaining the respect previously denied him.Revy has issues and internal strife all of her own, increasingly aggravated by the new arrival. It's the relationship between these two that's at the heart of the series, and gives events a centre of gravity. As white-collar Rock gradually grows into his new relationships, so Revy has to face up to new emotions and truths. Confrontations will make her doubt the real strengths of her much vaunted self-reliance, and how much her troubled past still influences her. It becomes obvious that, despite her best efforts, a problematic relationship is forming between her and the new arrival. Meanwhile, Rock's corporate-inspired guile, outwardly conservative image, and sly negotiating skills gained in a past life prove an increasingly valuable asset, even as he assesses his past existence in the light of the new.Operating out of the south Pacific city of Raonapur as the 'Lagoon Trading Company', Dutch's small professional team one held together by a quirky mixture of greed, bravado and camaraderie. Their main, continuous interaction is with a former Soviet military officer known as Balalaika, a big wheel in the crime world they inhabit and service. She quickly uses the Lagoon Company to help secure her ascendancy. In events after that, concerning a group of Nazis and a sunken submarine, she is largely absent, but comes to prominence again as events proceed, notably during the episodes of The Unstoppable Chambermaid. Here she helps to adjudicate at the finish, bringing to a climax stormy events between Revy and the murderous servant Roberta (a peculiarly enigmatic figure, demure but full of unstoppable violence), which have played out with a due nod to The Terminator. Towards the end of this first series Rock and Revy again provide the most interest from point of character until, at the close, we learn some more about her personal history from the CIA, which continues the process of humanising her, putting her life more in context.It's no surprise then that the closing credits of each show are shown over a notably melancholic sequence, reflecting Revy's trademark emotional desolation. The viewer follows her feet and lower legs along a beach watching her slowly discard cartridges, shoes and trademark twin handguns into the sand. Then, with a final flourish, Revy turns abruptly and confronts us with another weapon, as if warning against any attempt at communication. In contrast to the interest generated by such handicapped and resentful psychology, other parts of Black Lagoon are less rich in character studies, as individuals too readily give up what secrets they have. For instance, the Nazis faced by the team in the three-episode Die Ruckkehr des Adlers sequence are stereotypes, cardboard fanatics with none of the originality we find elsewhere. Only the claustrophobic scenes set inside the sunken submarine, rife again with tension between Rock and Revy, give this section much interest.A good deal of the show is taken up with violent set pieces that, typical of the genre, often bring an episode's climax. This is all orchestrated with some \u00e9lan, but in matters of sex Black Lagoon remains surprisingly reticent. Some viewers will note the coded lesbianism of Balalaika, or the constant smoking and cigarettes, those small symbols of virility, which are passed round or enjoyed by characters during the film. There are the hot pants of the busty Revy, clearly geared towards the fantasies of a male audience even if her continuously sexualised character remains an erotic aspiration only. She even expresses a surprising innocence early on when accidentally confronted by Balalaika's pornography (\"do you mean he is actually going to put that up her ass?\"). Mostly, adult sexuality is confined to the background: mute whores in bar rooms, or the surrounding street life.If the vividly realised experience of Black Lagoon can teach Revy - or us - anything more worthwhile, its the importance of establishing one's place in life with dignity, all the while discovering and valuing real friends. Worthwhile relationships are at a premium in a lawless city such as Raonapur. Those like Balalaika can only purchase the loyalty of associates; Nazis combine together through blind political obedience, Taiwanese assassins are necessarily hirelings, or servants like Roberta remain emotionally stunted. On Dutch's small, intimate boat however, people interrelate on a far more critical level. Here genuine loyalty and trust can quite literally mean matter of life and death.",

    "top_review": "I think this show has tons of potential, although I like it just the way it is now. I mean it has the potential to last several seasons, and I hope it does.Other reviews have given the basic info on what the show is about - a sci-fi crime show starring a bunch of smart young people, sort of like NCIS meet Dr. No. The producers use a sort of TV shorthand: instead of a long, complicated back story, the Federal agency that \"recruits\" Kristin is merely described as \"you can't guess what it is\", or words to that effect. Why waste time on yet another series of flashbacks and explanations? We all know what they're talking about. Some of the other reviewers are bothered by the impossibility and \"scientific\" inadequacy of the work space where the corpses are kept on hand for the stitching process. Again, so what? We've been watching Star Trek and Dr. No for years without worrying about it - the flashing lights and dim floating bodies are all one needs to get it; this is a science fiction detective show, for heaven's sake.I really like the way the geeks, including Kristin and her abrasive roommate, Camille, communicate. Along with the boys in the lab, they are unapologetically smarter than most of the rest of the humans in the world, and don't bother with the cutesy salutes to normal people that some shows use to make smart people more accessible. House and Monk are both examples of exceptionally unlikable people who nonetheless obtained a loyal fan following based on how their characters solved problems, and I think the same will happen with this show. I love the way some of the characters in this show zoom through pretty complicated dialogue with no explanation or apology, and call me crazy, but I thought Kristin's first experience stitching was gripping; the hyper- ventilation was a nice touch, and totally believable.I say give them a couple of seasons to show their stuff; they certainly got my attention.",

However, the more they came on, the more it got me to wondering why he didn't have a belly-button, so I decided to watch it. I'm really glad that I did. It was extremely interesting. It was the best. If you are really into shows that give off a bit of a mysterious air, then Kyle XY is definitely for you. I'm definitely going to be watching the next episodes, it's got me in suspense, and I want to know what is going to happen next. I give Kyle XY a 10 out of 10, it is an excellent show.",

It seems just like they created the other Octopod (the serial Italian movie about mafia) with a little less touch. Also I didn't like the so called Polat Alemdar smoking cigarettes quite in every screen, making him self very charismatic with his Zibo lighter (a friend of mine restarted smoking for this, I am not 100% sure thought but yes it gives you effect). Well the beautiful actress \u00d6zg\u00fc Namal (in Elif Eyl\u00fcl role) tried very hard and she showed her best performance but she could't do any miracle surrounded by ''not at all good'' actors.

Growing up as a small kid watching it everyday when coming home from school i quickly became a huge fan of the series and Spider-Man himself, if i hadn't had seen this series i would probably never had been a Spider-Man fan. Every episode was amazing they always had a great cliff hanger, great story, great characters, great voice actors and great animation. The Venom Saga was easily my favorite storyline i remember watching all the time on VHS after receiving it as a Christmas present, the storyline was amazing, i didn't read the Spider-Man comics to know the origin of the Symbiote but this TV Show told it better as far as staying in Spider-Mans world.The Storyline was very dark and scary if only the Spider-Man 3 film had followed the symbiote story it would have made more sense and been better but the storyline was pure incredible, Peters dark side was unique and scary. Venom quickly became one of my favorite villain to ever step into the Superhero world. The series didn't have the character of Gwen Stacy but i was totally fine by, i didn't discover her character until years later. The Green Goblin was always my second favorite character of the show his design was perfect and his character was perfect as well and he delivered one of the most amazing evil laughs i have ever heard. The series didn't feature much Electro so that disappointed me because he is my favorite villain ever believe it or not. I always enjoyed The Black Cat and Spider-Man episodes mainly because i enjoyed the love relationship storyline a ton, i enjoyed it more then the Peter and MJ story lines likely because Black Cat was like Spider-Man a lot fighting crime. If you are now in your teens and are a die hard Spider-Man fan it is likely because you grew up watching this series, like myself. This series is very special to me and it will always remain my favorite cartoon series ever. 10/10",

Bill Cosby once called this show a \"modern day minstrel\" and yet I'm still waiting to see \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" reruns on Cartoon Network, maybe Mr. Cosby won't allow them to be shown because it would eat at his own guilty conscience. Martin is a comedic genius and the other characters, Gina, Pam, Tommy and Cole contrasted well with his over-the-top style, usually ending up the butts of his jokes. Although at some times Martin would come across as crass and surly, by the end of the show his generosity and warm heart would shine through. Long before Eddie Murphy in \"The Nutty Professor\", Martin mastered playing multiple characters. From Sheneneh to Mama Payne, Roscoe the snot nosed kid, Otis the security guard, Dragonfly Jones, Elroy the mechanic, white boy Bob and who could forget Jerome \"the playa from the Himalayas\", Martin amazingly portrayed every different character with their own unique personalities. Some of the funniest moments ever in my opinion came during Martin's interaction with the old lady, Miss Jerri, or Hustle Man (Tracy Morgan at his funniest) and of course you can't forget his occasional visit from Bruh Man from the \"fiff flo\". If loving this show is wrong, then I don't wanna be right. So, to Bill Cosby and all the other bougie black folks that dissed this show, I'll tell you like Eddie Murphy said in \"Raw\", shut the f*** up and have a Coke and a smile!",

    "top_review": "The Adventures of Pete and Pete is what more television shows should strive for. Kids can enjoy it, but I was 19 when I started watching it and have been intrigued ever since (I'm 24 now).  This show is unique, humorous but not in the traditional way, very well written, very surreal and there is enough mystery to leave a variety of impressions and interpretations.  Things that should be small events are blown up to very large scale circumstances with apocalyptic consequences.  Other stories take completely random and unreal situations and make them a part of everyday life.  If people thought like this on a daily basis, everyone's life would be much more exciting. Artie, \"The Strongest Man in the World\", is a skinny fellow in striped pyjamas.  His favorite smell is tire air.  He's little Pete's personal superhero.  Artie, who calls things \"Pipe\" when they're going well, is the only man capable of vanquishing a bowling ball that comes between two brothers.  Without special effects the writers have created a very convincing alternate universe. The stories are usually called \"weird\".  More appropriately, they are metaphorical and mysterious.  Little Pete and friends must survive a gym class dodge ball match, while Big Pete needs to study for a test. Whatensues is an epic of revolution and facing your fears.  Cryptic characters come and go, bearing vague clues and meanings such as an old woman with a leg vein pattern matching an Iowa road map (though I've seen a map of Iowa and it's really just a big grid).  Other times, yes, it's just plain weird.  Very funny too. Pete and Pete breaks away from every boring and trite television show out there.  The problems on most sit-coms are stupid, petty and seem like every other show out there (everyday life is great, but WATCHING everyday life sucks).  Pete and Pete breaks out of that completely.  The storylines create profound meanings from quirky twists on everyday life; the quest for perfection...using an underwear inspector, a \"lost\" favorite song and the journey to get it back.  If there is ANYTHING to compare this show to, it's like Tim Burton got control of the Wonder Years...kind of. Pete and Pete says there is excitement in everyday life and implies that just about anything is possible...why not be a bus driver or a bear for career day? If TV were truly what it should be:  A medium to entertain, inspire and teach the masses, we would see so many more shows like this.  Talented writers who made something unique right down to the theme music. And the guest stars!  They're offbeat yet recognizable and respectable... Steve Buchemi, Janine Garofolo, Chris Elliot, Adam West.  Then rock and roll stars: Michael Stipe, Iggy Pop and Juliana Hatfield.  Finally out of the blue you get Monday Night Football's Frank Gifford and PBS's John McLaughlin.  Like I said, unique right down to the theme song. This show is awesome.",

This is a satirical commentary on the lives of kids who are between the ages of 10 and 13.  At least one area in every big city has to have kids like this.  Every kid in America has at one point has tried to scam money out of someone.  Every kid in America has at one point been a bully to the weak or been bullied themselves by the weak.  Every kid in America has shown hypocritical to their personality.The show's basic premise has the three main characters (Ed, Edd, and Eddy) interacting with nine major supporting characters but it doesn't stop there.  One of the most revealing aspects of \"Ed, Edd, and Eddy\" is the interactions between the supporting cast themselves.  I remember one episode where the Kanker sisters kidnapped Kevin and tied him to a large wheel.  The girls seemed to like Kevin as well as the Ed Boys.  Ed released Kevin but the latter decided to be a complete dick and not say give out gratitude to his rescuer.  Another episode showed Jonny 2x4 getting pushed down a hill in a tire by Sarah and Kevin.  This to me shows that early adolesence is a trying time for all those who are going through it.Another major aspect of \"Ed, Edd, and Eddy\" I like are the distinct characters.  Every character on that show is well-written so they can have depth and personality.  The situations they all get involved may be seriously far-fetched but I think it brings out the best parts of each personality.  Each character that was created to portray some sort of typical adolescent personality (eg Eddy is the brainy wimp and Ed is the stupid brawn).  Each character has its' own flaws and they are displayed perfectly in each episode they appear.Possibly the best aspect of \"Ed, Edd, and Eddy\" in the gritty-like pencil and watercolor animation.  It gives you the point of view of actual art that an early adolescent that might create in relation to his life and friends.  At that age, artistry of that caliber is well-done and genius.  The animation gives you the feel that you are actually in the mind of an early adolescent as they create such a visual landscape.Overall, I think this a very original premise.  It is a satirical look at the lives of twelve distinct characters who are in the stage of early adolescence.  Each character's personality and depth are well-written and perfectly thought out.  The animation is exceptional because it portrays the idea of superior early adolescent pencil and watercolor artistry.  This shows ranks high on my list with \"Beavis and Butthead\", \"Courage the Cowardly Dog\", and \"The Simpsons\" for best animated shows of all time.Grade: A++, the best show on Cartoon Network",

    "top_review": "I remember early in the year 2000 listening to a local AM Talk Radio Station in Los Angeles (I believe it was Phil Hendrie). The topic of the hour was \"What's your favorite TV Show currently on the air?\" For the next hour I heard a lot of references to two shows: \"Malcolm in the Middle\" and this other show, \"Popular.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I had already seen \"Malcolm\" and knew it was hilarious. But what about \"Popular?\"The commercials made it look like a typical weekly teeny-bop High School show, a la \"Saved By The Bell,\" but in Prime-Time (lest we forget Zach did go to college in the evenings though). The amount of praise I heard for \"Popular\" made me check it out.The advertisements were wrong.What I found in this show was a sleek, hilarious, dramatic, clever, filled to the brim with 80's references show not about kids in High School today (circa 1999-2000), but if kids from my generation were to go to High School today (yes, I went to High School in the 80's).I think the failure of \"Popular\" was the advertising I referred to earlier for the show...it was going after kids in high school for ratings. But the show was made for (I feel) an entirely different generation. If only the ones it was made for had watched....it would probably still be on.This is one of the few programs I have ever seen that managed to balance outright slapstick comedy with serious drama...and it did it so well in my opinion that I seriously mourned the loss of the show when it was canceled.My favorite Season Two moments - 1) Mary Cherry's (Leslie Grossman) audition for judges, including Jim J. Bullock (way before \"American Idol\" became a household name). \"Rock Me Amadeus, by FALCO!\"2) Nicole Julian's (Tammy Lynn Michaels) \"rise\" to Class President (one of the most clever and complex episodes ever written for television -- flat-out incredible comedy).3) Every scene with Michelle Phillips (\"Abra-abra-cadabra!!!!\").4) The \"Gay\" episode about Bobbi Glass (Diane Delano) - it gave me chills and again proved how the writers were almost magically able to juggle comedy and drama every week.The casting of the show was simply brilliant. Everyone did an incredible job and I am pleased to see several of the cast riding other roads to fame as of 2008 (Christopher Gorham on \"Jake 2.0\" and then the successful \"Ugly Betty\").The only thing I can pray for at this point are either reruns (Lifetime or Oxygen I'm guessing...but maybe Comedy Central?) or, *gasp* -- A DVD Release. Then a lot more people can have a chance to see a show that I firmly believe should have been \"Popular.\"*EDIT* Both Seasons are on DVD now. There really IS a God!My personal thanks to the callers of that Los Angeles AM Talk Radio Program who touted the praises of this show. You got it right, and I'm glad I saw of it what I did.",

I loved the series Quantum Leap and was eagerly anticipating Journeyman. I was not disappointed. I watched the first five episodes back to back. I couldn't turn the television off. I took a few days off and then watched the remaining episodes. Again, I'm really enjoying this series and can't wait to see the episode on December 13th. The story lines are wonderfully thought out and the acting is superb. If you've read any other comments that speak unfavorably about the comparisons between Journeyman and Quantum Leap (two totally different plots), Kevin McKidd's accent (I detected none...but I am not a linguist by profession!), or a perceived notion the successive episodes do not relate to each other (they absolutely do tie in together), please take them with a grain of salt. Each episode keeps me at the edge of my with the anticipation of what's going to happen next. I urge everybody to give Journeyman a chance.",

While it had extremely cheesy and bad acting and horrible writing, it was a fun show for the kids and the pre-teens. I remember always dying of laughter when I watched this show when I was a kid on Saturday mornings. Screech to me was like Marlon Brando in The Godfather, I thought the whole cast was brilliant. Now I still watch this show as a grown up, I really can't help it, it's like a car accident, you know you shouldn't look, but you can't help it. I know the writing was very bad and the situations are beyond unrealistic, but I think the reason I love this show still is because of it's innocence.The show had a good influence on kids, it sounds crazy, but it did deal with a lot of issues that most kids have to deal with school. While I admit that they acted like Jesse was on heroine when she was simply taking caffeine pills, it still tried it's best to show you to be a true original. The story is simple, just 6 teenagers going through their daily lives in Bayside High School. They deal with the daily pressures: homework, tests, love, drugs, popularity, and friendship. Together they deal with these pressures along with the help of their loving principal, Mr. Belding.Each character was lovable in their own way. Zack who was the smooth talker and ruled Bayside who could get any girl he wanted. Slater who was the high school jock and Zack's best friend. Screech, Zack's other best friend, who was the geek of the high school. Kelly who is the hottie cheerleader of Bayside and Zack's love interest. Lisa who is the fashion icon of the group and is Screech's long time crush. And Jesse, the study addict goodie two-shoe's and is also the vice president of the student council.While each the group isn't what normally clicked in high school, it still was a lot of fun to watch them because of how opposite they were. It was always so charming to see them work together, who wouldn't have wanted friends like them? True, the situations in the show are extremely unbelievable, the acting isn't up to par, and it's cheesy messages, this was always a pleasure to watch. You have to admit that sometimes it does bring a few laughs. I'm not afraid to admit it, I still enjoy watching this show and I think you will too, just have fun and admit it, there's something memorizing about it. Otherwise people wouldn't be talking about it still almost 20 years later.",

Then you have the undercard or as I say fillers, and this is definitely on the filler list.I'm watching this in the UK and like this show while there's basically naff all on currently. I'm really not sure the reviewer's have been watching the same show but it's all about opinions and there's counts just like mine does I hope. It may well be a one season wonder in the end, but currently there's a lot going on like political gamesmanship, murder, blackmail and a reasonable storyline to keep me interested. As said I do class this as an undercard type show, but it's watchable and doesn't deserve the reviews it's been getting. Personally a lot of shows that I've watched in this class have been canned by the TV powers that be. Which begs the question, do my great American cousins actually know what there watching sometimes, when shows like Grey's (bailed after Season 5, The Mentalist bailed and a few more I dare not mention) are still out there going strong.I love the US drama, best TV on the planet. They're very few UK shows of equal and we have a tradition in the UK of only having 6 episode seasons, less if you think of Luther.This is a new golden age with so many great US shows, 3 I've already mentioned, alas BB is no more (nothing touches that). I'm enjoying Hostages, just like The Blacklist, Revolution, Under The Dome and Continuum. All enjoyable filler shows to watch while the main events are on break.

    "top_review": "This decade has been a bit of a disappointment in terms of television programs. After a decade of excellent cartoons, sitcoms, and dramas, the 2000s has been quite lackluster in terms of prime time. With few exceptions (My main one being ABC's LOST) out there, I've turned my attention to video games and especially movies for entertainment much more often. However, there's a television show out there that delivers some of the most entertaining television in recent memory. The Travel Channel has been on a roll lately with rising ratings and whatnot, but thanks to Man vs. Food, the Travel Channel and reality programming in general has reached new quality peaks.Man vs. Food is easily, hands-down, the best new television show within the last two years. Well-edited, perfectly hosted, and with enough energy to generate Manhattan, this program is a wonderful breath of fresh air for television. While it isn't for weak stomachs, the content is family-friendly, well-paced, and thoroughly enjoyable. The host is entertaining, caring, lovable, and has a love for food that most of us can only dream of having.The concept is nice and simple: Adam Richman travels the country in search of food challenges that could make your arteries clog just witnessing the carnage. To add to the mayhem, he also scours the city in search of the more popular and successful eateries in the area. Unlike Andrew Zimmern, Richman doesn't attempt to really gross out, he tires to expand your horizons as to what you eat and how you actually eat it. Man vs. Food focuses on quality as well as quantity. Richman has already on Season 1 introduced us to a dozen award-winning restaurants as well as over a dozen crazyinsane eating challenges. Along the way he interviews people, and also runs into celebrities from time to time\u0097ranging from Gladys Knight to baseball star Kevin Youkilis. The spotlight is never hogged; Richman shares the camera with the scenery, the local folks, and of course the food.The main appeal in Man vs. Food are the challenges in the end that pretty much prove that Americans are easily among the biggest lovers (and most creative crafters) of food in the entire world. The human versus food battles range from eating a 12-pound pizza to eating a 5-pound burger (plus 5 pounds of fries) to fighting a 7-pound breakfast burrito to even taking on spicy food so hot it can make people bleed. Adam Richman, despite his lack of competitive eating skills, rises to almost all the challenges and the results range from hilarious to gross to perhaps even uplifting. It's just much too easy to root for him to win them all. Plus, why go against someone that introduces you to slices of pizza larger than babies and donuts bigger than your face? Locations are scattered all over, never limited to any one type of food or one region of the country. He has traveled as far north as Seattle and Boston, and made his way all the way down to Atlanta, and all the way west to Los Angeles and San Jose. But have no fear, with so many lovely cities in the United States, I can guarantee that we won't find an end to all the pursuing challenges; his main enemies are time, and his health. The only drawback would be if your city has yet to be featured in the program. Give it time, at this rate, he'll be knocking on your door.Bottom Line: The best new show on television, hands-down. The concept has been done before, but has never been done with such humor and bubbly energy. Adam Richman is the best host in all of Travel Channel, and remains one of the few modern shows I'm willing to watch multiple times. America is never seen in a negative light, as the subtle and hidden beauty of the diversity and creativity of the country sparkles throughout the all-too-short 30 minutes of the program. I wish this show all the success in the world, because it deserves it, and I'd hate to see another Arrested Development situation develop. Highly, highly recommend.",

    "top_review": "This is a must see for Sherlockians and uninitiated alike. 'The Return of Sherlock Holmes', (as with the 'Adventures'), contain some of the best episodes of the Granada TV series. The writers stick closely to the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle and when they do depart there is good dramatic reason. Jeremy Brett continues to dazzle as Sherlock Holmes despite difficulties in his private life at this time, and Edward Hardwicke's Watson (incidentally, whose father Sir Cedric Hardwicke played Holmes once upon a time) is just as intelligent and warm as his predecessor David Burke in the 'Adventures'. Yes, Watson IS intelligent, contrary to very unfair previous portrayals. Hardwicke's style is more naturalistic and perfectly complements Brett's expansive theatrics.The lively 221b Baker Street set is a delight, and the music must be given special mention, as it is excellent. Patrick Gowers takes the Baker Street theme and embellishes and embroiders it to suit the mood and tone of each episode. He is able to vary it from choral to Renaissance to concerto style effortlessly. The supporting cast is usually strong, though sometimes there will be the odd one who overdoes it a bit. But you cannot accuse anyone involved in these productions with half-heartiness.Cracks only begin to show in the last few episodes of the series from 'The Devil's Foot' onwards, filmed after Brett experienced a mental breakdown. He seems to lose some of his energy and lustre, but the effect is that of an older, wiser and more compassionate version of the Great Detective, who is so often described as being cold.All in all, I highly recommend this series; you will never see such a happy combination of good screenplay, music, costumes, set design and of course excellent actors in the same production of the adventures of the elusive Sherlock Holmes.",

I have never read the books, and I don't want to start now in fear that I'll spoil it for myself. Here are some reasons why you should watch Pretty Little Liars. Great Cast! - The casting was really done well. Although Spencer does look a bit older than the rest of the girls, it still is great. They all have great chemistry with each other on screen, it really makes it believable. I believe every single one of these girls its crazy, and I am like on the edge of my seat wondering who is \"A\". Great Story! - At the end of each episode i get mad! Its like damn gotta wait another week for another one. Its so addicting. It really is, just watch it. Secret Life is a mess, This is A lot BETTER!!! This should be on Mondays instead of Tuesdays!",

It was STTNG that finally allowed for a very advanced and yet BELIEVABLE \"evolved\" human behavior involved in space travel.I admired Captain Jean-Luc Picard for his reserved Brit style, and the tension between him and Dr. Beverly Crusher.  Who did not like watching Lieutenant Commander Data and Lieutenant Geordi LaForge spar over human behavior?  What about the short brilliant life of Lieutenant Natasha Yar? Who didn't tune in to see that?  Commander William Riker was amazing to watch, as he grew a beard and a conscience -- while still being able to keep up with the great Lieutenant Worf, the only Klingon (as yet) in Star Fleet!?Those of you out there trying still to wage the Star Wars - Star Trek battle for supremacy -- grow up!

It presented Backstrom as a crime solver who just guesses.Maybe because of the great cast that surrounds the star. Like Dennis Haysbert, whose role in the show is greater than the first episode showed.Could it be because once the show gets rolling, Backstrom (Rainn Wilson) becomes more than just a misanthropic cynic with no apparent crime solving skills. In fact, later episodes show him to be a cynical realist who is able to put himself in the shoes of suspects and perps. His Special Crimes Unit works on one case at a time, allowing them to devote all their time and talents to cases that warrant special attention (or are politically important). Backstrom is also not PC, making him more entertaining and more in tune with the truth. Like many detectives, he will do whatever is expedient if it allows him to solve a crime or convict a criminal--two goals which are sometimes mutually exclusive. This is a character with room to grow. I will watch to see where the series takes him.Update 4/3/2015: I am changing my grade to \"8\". The show has been routinely entertaining and the backstory for Backstrom is addimg much more depth to the character. While he may have a dark center, there are occasional moments of enjoyment that he allows himself. I hope he learns to like himself just a little more as the episodes roll out.",

Yet her work and clever look always produce blunt and brash outspoken performances she's a fine actress. So I was so glad when the USA Network decided to give her a series of her own, and \"Necessary Roughness\" fits her perfect, as Callie shows she has some range as an actress.Set in Long Island, New York Thorne is Dr. Dani Santino who as an upscale and elegant attractive psychotherapist mother of two finds herself in the dumps when she discovers her husband has cheated on her. Yet for every negative a positive will come, it seemed like a dream for Dani when she gets the call for pro football's New York Hawks(a fictional one)to be a therapist and shrink for the team. And her most famous client is troubled star wide receiver Terrence King(Mehcad Brooks)and this cat gives Dani plenty of headaches and mental pain as talent is no break from being a head case! Aside from that dealing with the growing pains of her teenage kids is enough as she has to monitor many of their moves.Still the doc has a little side pleasure in the form of some one night stands with team trainer the hunky Matthew(Marc Blucas). As anyone would agree and see why that Matthew has a thing for Dani she's one hot sexy doc! And her professional work is well respected as it leads her to counsel and analyze many other type of clients from entertainers, celebrities, and other sports and media figures and even politicians as everyone needs a shrink! Overall this is one good series that proves with a little advice and direction fear and many other problems can be faced and overcome in a permanent manner. And Callie Thorne is a delight she's a tough as nails and very sexy cougar who cares about people problems in this series. So do yourself a favor and take the field and get ready for the game of life that's just \"Necessary Roughness\".",

And there's much more still to come.You won't see the novel reassembled piece by piece, but what you'll get instead is a mordant, hilarious, moving, masterpiece of the art of adaptation and a brilliant cast extracting every last every drop of juice from the fruit (sucked separately, of course).Cranford is vibrantly alive and kicking as it never has been before.

It's also really nice to see more female-oriented animation that isn't always centered around \"girly\" themes.I wouldn't say this is what I would call a \"laugh-out-loud\" cartoon, but the humor delivers through visual gags and dialogue that are definitely worth a crack or two. I think this is good because I think a lot of shows nowadays try too hard to be funny, but fail miserably. The main purpose of this show seems to be more centered around adventure than anything else, so it seems somewhat refreshing.Is it worth the watch? Definitely.

    "top_review": "I had started watching Fringe when it aired in my country, and at first, I didn't really find it particularly interesting. However, I decided to persevere with it, and I'm very glad I did. This show is not perfect, but it's definitely not as bad as all these reviews tend to make out. With each episode (so far), I find myself more deeply immersed in the plot, more involved with the characters, and I can't wait until the next one airs. A lot of these other reviews say it's worse than 'Lost' - which isn't true. I tried watching Lost, for the entire first season, but I found myself completely bored, with no real plot line to follow. The opposite is true with Fringe. Each episode has two plots - One, the overall plot of the series, and two, the plot of the individual episode, such as the investigation. This is common practice, but Fringe makes it.. fresher.All in all, don't make any decisions on whether to watch this or not based off reviews on here. There's a lot of controversy - some hate it, some love it - just watch it for a while and judge it for yourself. I personally don't like the first 10 or so episodes, so I recommend you at least for a bit after that. They honestly do get better. 9/10",

The storyline is random but worth watching. Its hilarious on some parts you don't think are suppose to be funny but the style of it makes it so.All the characters are lovable or at least likable.And you'll feel good after watching it.And if that's not good enough for then I don't know what is.My only advice is to watch it on Cartoon Network on Thursdays at 8:30pm or 20:30 and judge for yourself.So have a nice time watching The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack! : )",

    "top_review": "I might as well just come right out and say it to start with--I have never been a fan of Anime. In general, I watch it if it happens to be on, but more as background noise than for the actual plot content. But this series changed my mind about all that.The first few episodes I watched were on Adult Swim. I liked the idea of magic being explained in a (somewhat) scientific fashion, so I found recordings of the aired episodes online (with subtitles) with the intention of watching them whenever I was bored.I say without shame that I, who have not watched more than a half hour of anime in a single sitting, watched all fifty-one episodes in a single sitting. And it had me sitting on the edge of my seat every time. When a few of the episodes were corrupted, I even edited the videos manually with a hex editor to get them to play properly.I was really turned off to Anime originally because of the way the Japanese animators use frame rates. You only really need one or two frames per second to show movement--and this contrasts with the relatively constant frame rate in American cartoons. It can look rather ugly if you're not used to it. For action scenes, though, they bring out the full 30fps, and the sudden contrast between 2fps, with the character standing there, and 30fps, where the character is executing these stunning martial arts moves, is an incredible sight to see.But I would like to say that this series is a complete series. The last episode does, in fact, contain the conclusion--no premature terminations here. Most anime contains a \"Lead-out\" which gives the viewer something to think about. It makes it seem more like the characters are still doing something, still living, even after the series is over. I must say that makes the end of the series even harder to bear, because believe it or not, it's like saying goodbye to a close friend.This series has definitely had a major impact on me. It is worth the time (or money) to acquire it. I wouldn't recommend watching all fifty-one episodes together like I did. The intrigue of the plot is intended to hit the viewers like a hammer, and it keeps them coming back week after week. If you watch them all together, it begins and ends so quickly you feel like you've been hit by a truck when it finally DOES end.Full Metal Alchemist is a prime example of excellent story writing. It'll make you laugh and maybe even make a few of you cry, but one thing it won't do is leave you disappointed.",

It has it all, great characters, roll on the floor humor, and a fantastic production level. It starts out a tad bit slowly as each of the main characters are introduced, but once it gets going it really takes off.My favorite aspect of the series is that unlike in similar long-running series, the characters actually grow and change from the events in the past. Once a bridge is complete, it doesn't disappear to never be spoken of again, it leaves an impact on the characters and world. In part because of this, but also just because they are just extremely well thought out and likable, the characters are realistic and easily relatable. This series is a lot of fun, but there are also some real tearjerkers when back-stories start getting revealed. Lets just say that no one in the guild has exactly had an easy time of it.This series is very high energy, and has some of the best action scenes around. It's got something for everyone and seems to be perfectly set up to take the anime mantle of next big thing.",

First of all, there are very few TV shows out there that are in every way true to life. Of course the situations aren't completely plausible! That's why we watch TV shows in the first place - we're entertained by things that we would not normally do or see. If I wanted to watch something \"realistic\" I'd just tape myself and watch it at the end of the day.What's real in this show is that every character is complicated and has layers in their personality. The bad guy isn't all bad, and the good guy isn't so great either. There's just this gray area - just the way people are.Then there's the complaint that Veronica Mars is \"too smart.\" And that's a bad thing because...? I'm sick of mindless shows that give away the ending in the first minute and/or have the same tired plots. If witty is not your thing, that is sad and someone needs a good dose of \"sense of humor.\" Maybe everything we watch on TV should be bland and predictable from now on? By the way, detective work is supposed to be logical - not flashy. When you want to look for someone, you'd automatically put a trace on things they own. What did you expect would happen? Some kind of laser tracking thingy?The writing on this show is amazing, as are the actors and everything else. The artistic value is also incredible.

    "top_review": "Wow. This new show certainly knows how to get your attention. Within the first five minutes of the first episode you will have a very clear picture of what it meant to have to undergo surgery at a time when even today's most common surgical procedures had hardly been tested \u0096 let alone successfully. With this new series, writers Jack Amiel and Michael Begler have created a fascinating \u0096 and gripping \u0096 look at the humble beginnings of modern medicine, and frankly: it made me realize just how lucky I am to live today. The show's title is derived from the 'Knickerbocker Hospital', a fictional hospital at the turn of the 20th. century in New York which serves as the centre stage around which the lives and struggles of the protagonists revolve. 'The Nick' shows us an uneasy, turbulent time where everything is in motion, and although the benefits of the so called \"modern age\" are already waiting around the corner, the situation for people without money is grim. Immigrants live in horrible sanitary situations, little children have to work in factories and social frictions and racial prejudice run deep within society.Clive Owen does an excellent job portraying a conflicted but passionate surgeon who's constantly trying to push the boundaries by inventing or refining surgical methods in the hope of lowering the mortality rate among his patients. The rest of the cast is also terrific; their performances - along with the great writing - help create a sense of realism that is rarely seen in films or TV-shows depicting that era. The same can be said of the fantastic production values \u0096 the team behind 'The Knick' obviously went to great lengths to portray everyday life of that era as accurately as possible. Virtually every frame oozes quality: the city of New York at the beginning of the twentieth century has been meticulously recreated and every busy street corner, alley or candle-lit room feels authentic. Small wonder, perhaps, given that the director, producer, cinematographer and editor of all 20 episodes is none other than multi-talent and Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh.My verdict: This is a fascinating, gripping portrayal of the dawn of modern surgery as well as an intense human drama and an authentic look at an era we normally only get to see in films about Sherlock Holmes or Jack the Ripper. Highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

However, instead of presenting these issues as they are, they alternately project them through the exploits of four young boys in South Park, Colorado. Unfortunately, many people take the show solely at face value, refusing to see the intelligence in it - South Park is admittedly filled with racist and sexist jokes, along with other offensive material. The problem lies within the fact that most people don't seem to understand the concept of satire and self parody. I admit that I, myself, was one of these people - for years I refused to watch that \"garbage,\" until finally a friend forced me to actually watch a whole episode, and I realized that the show was actually making a point.So, if you haven't done so, go - watch an episode.

    "critic_rating": "7.9", 
    "top_review": "We've all seen shows that started with a very exciting pilot suffer a slow boring death. A good show needs more than a good concept at the start, it needs good storytelling, good acting, likable characters and it needs to find a good pace.The pilot of Chicago Fire was very weak. The story lines felt too familiar (old friends drifted apart through tragedy, secret painkiller addiction, unrequited love etc) and didn't blend together. And, as you can see on this IMDb page, in the next few days a lot reviewers burnt Chicago Fire to the ground.For some reason I kept on watching. The second episode was a bit better, but by the third episode the show really found it's stride. I've just finished watching the fifth episode and came the conclusion that 1. Chicago Fire somehow ended up to be my favorite new show of the year and 2. All the negative IMDb-reviews are now really unfair. Which is why I suddenly felt compelled to write a review of my own. I never do this, so bear with me. Chicago Fire is not a procedural 'fire of the week' show. It actually does the ensemble drama really well. There is nice balance between the characters and I especially like how these characters connect with each other and how the story lines are slowly developed. In a way, it reminds me of The Good Wife, but with more action scenes (which is a great compliment in my world) The friendship between roommates Leslie Shay (Lauren German) and Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney) is great. Severide plays the tough on the outside, soft on the inside guy, who walks away from his medical problems by secretly taking lots of illegal painkillers. Not very original or interesting, but I've got to admit that my cynic self is really warming up to Kelley. Partly because Kinney plays the part very well, and partly because of his genuine scenes and aforementioned friendship with Shay. Shay is gay, but that's not an issue on the show, just a part of who she is. As it should be, I applaud the CF writers for the way they portray her. Her scenes with fellow paramedic Dawson (Monica Raymund)are among my favorites. Dawson also has some cute scenes with new kid on the block Peter Mills (Charlie Barnett), but is too much in love with lieutenant Matthew Casey to notice their chemistry. Sadly for her, Casey is already engaged to another medical professional. This may sound a little soapy or gooey, but actually, Dawson kicks ass. Literally. Which gets her in to trouble sometimes.Lt. Casey is arguably the real star of the show. He is played by Jesse Spencer, whom I liked in his House MD days, but who really impressed me on Chicago Fire. He plays the classic good guy, but not in a boring way. His intense storyline involving a dirty cop truly propelled the show to greater heights. I'm not gonna name every character or storyline, but they're all getting better very fast. (Quick shout out to Eamonn Walker who plays the awesome Chief Boden.) The show may be a bit unrealistic, but that's not what I look for in a good drama. I'm a big fan of Breaking Bad and Dexter, both are very entertaining, and excellently written \u00e1nd acted shows, but both are also very unrealistic. Chicago Fire may not yet be on their level of awesomeness, but it is getting there. My point just is, I am really glad I gave this show another chance and I hope that you will too.",

Critics of the show call it \"awful\", \"gross\" and \"disgusting\", although by the time the show hit the airwaves the network censors had watered it down from Angus Oblong's original concept.  I wonder what their reaction would have been had there been no censorship.What bothers me most about the cancellation of shows like this is that moronic pablum such as King of the Hill is everlasting while the Oblongs, Futurama, The Critic and the Family Guy get cancelled (although the Family Guy has re-emerged on cable with new episodes.)To those critics who slam the show: if you don't like it, don't watch it. Don't get it thrown off the air by complaining about it.  To those who love the show:  you can still catch episodes on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network at 12:30AM & 3:30AM Mondays, and according to Angus Oblong's website, in Canada on \"TeleToon\".

Of these labels, Chuck Rhoades, played by Emmy winner Paul Giamatti, embodies a relentless, savage beast most.Overall, the pilot definitely warrants viewing from any fan of television. The esoteric language of the business world as well as the focus on rich guys in \"a pissing contest\" might turn off viewers at first glance. However, the writers manage to make compelling characters with interesting dialogue that begs viewers to stick around for the next episode.",

The postmodern comedy for the 21 century was ushered in by The Office(UK) and Arrested Development, but I, for one, doubted something could come along and satiate my longing for another truly, original comedy.Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly, clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS.I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family.And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the modern family and modern comedy.Great f_cking show.

Rarely do you hear the same music twice (which has, on numerous occasions destroyed other series where you hear the same stuff over again over numerous seasons), the voice acting is always great (from the main characters to Mr. Katz and the Goose God), the animation is great (the varied reactions they give Courage is worth watching for alone) and the stories are always unique, even when they're not up to the series standard bar (which is pretty darn high, IMO).Ultimately, the series is a culmination of so many excellent factors, with the most important being the way that it can be scary but not so much that you can't let kids watch it. It's the perfect black humor cartoon for kids and adults that I wish was out on DVD, as I'd buy it in an instant.My personal favorite episodes are \"The Chicken From Outer Space\", \"Revenge of the Chicken From Outer Space\", \"King Ramses' Curse\" and \"The Gods Must Be Goosey\".

Back then I had a big geeky interest in UFO:s and the paranormal so you can imaging how I felt when this TV-show came along. It was like my heart could explode of joy. Well, the geeky interest for UFO:s faded and sometimes I was quite tired of the X-files but I always kept on watching. The funny thing is that it is now, a year after the \"end\" of the show, when I'm 27 years old, that I realize how extremely important the show has been to me. It has been a big part of my life for ten years. And now, life feels a bit empty without it.What is the best part of the X-files then? Well, of course, first of all, Mulder and Scully and the tension between them. You can't describe it with words, it's magical. That is, very good acting. (If the main goals of life for Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny weren't to become icons, well tough luck :)!) Second, the Gothic atmosphere. The X-files is forests, fog, darkness, snow, mud, autumn, rain, desert. Mmm, me love. Third, the dialog. \"SCULLY: Mulder, I wouldn't put myself on the line for anybody but you. MULDER: If there's an ice tea in that bag, could be love. SCULLY: Must be fate, Mulder. Root beer.\" That says about everything. Forth, all the other characters. They are so complex and carefully created. And fifth, the story. I mean, this is the story of all stories. It has everything. A love bigger than the universe, heroes, diplomats, true evil, a father-son-tragedy and a big, huge and completely wonderful conspiracy.

    "top_review": "On first glance, American Dad looks like a carbon copy of Seth MacFarlane's \"other\" show Family Guy. The animation is near identical, the lead character Stan Smith's knuckle headed optimism and in-your-face presentation doesn't so much recall Peter Griffin as grab you by the throat and scream in your face and Roger the alien and Klaus the goldfish work in much the same way Stewie and Brian do in the previous show. So far so very familiar, as though MacFarlane dressed up his fourth FG series with different characters when it was initially cancelled so as to stay on the air but stick with it, and American Dad will eventually reveal itself as a superior cartoon to it's predecessor.Sure, the humour is once again a mixture of insightful witticisms, biting satire and odd bursts into toilet humour but rather than the chaos of Family Guy where the plot seems to revolve round the jokes, here the opposite is true. The flashbacks are almost totally absent and instead each episode features a structure and character development that is normally missing from the first show. Okay some of the episodes fall a bit flat but nevertheless, there are considerably more hits than there are misses and when it's good, it's brilliant. \"A Smith In The Hand\" for example is in this writer's humble opinion, the funniest thing MacFarlane and his team have ever produced.What's more, American Dad is considerably more politically-orientated and everything you could conceive about the USA's current state of fear mongering and distrust is put beneath a microscope and parodied mercilessly. Stan Smith is a boorish depiction of all that paranoia rolled into one and some of his outbursts and overreactions are hilarious. Take the scene where he locks up his new Arab neighbours in his back garden for instance in a moment that scarily recalls the nightmarish conditions of Guantanamo bay yet still manages to be side splittingly funny or any of his numerous conceited one-liners (\"only women have emotions son, they come from their ovaries\").Only time will tell if American Dad can outlive the shadow of it's far more successful big brother, but like the relationship between Futurama and the Simpsons beforehand, it's often a far funnier and considerably more focused show that deserves a wider audience.

There's Roger, the sarcastic space alien who rescued Stan from Area 51 who deeply resents the fact that he's not allowed to leave the house, and therefore, has been reduced to drinking wine and smoking cigarettes, and Klaus, a lascivious, German-speaking goldfish; the result of a CIA experiment gone seriously wrong where the CIA tried to give a fish a German man's brain.

The series, based on the novel by Robert Littell, follows a deep cover agent embedded in dangerous situations, working in the interest of national security.Through the course of the episode, the audience follows Bean's character through his undercover work and discovers the struggles he faces in his home life. All of this pales in comparison to the greater story when Bean's character is confronted and told he is not who he thinks he is; the life he believes is his is just a legend - a fictional character history created for the purpose of undercover operations.The concept is intriguing and the pilot episode is well balanced. Although, more action sequences would have been welcome. The supporting cast, which includes Ali Larter, Steve Harris and Tina Majorino, among others, is impressive. Bean's acting prowess is the real reason to tune it. One scene in particular has Bean shifting into a different character in front of the other characters and the transformation is a highlight of the episode.If the rest of the series follows the formula of the pilot episode, audiences can expect a new threat every week, as well as an opportunity for Bean's acting skills to shine as he transforms into a new character every week.",

    "top_review": "\"Drop Dead Diva\" is a new series on Lifetime. The pilot is very enjoyable, mainly because of the star, Brooke Elliot, who is fabulous. She plays a brilliant, highly successful attorney, Jayne, who pays no attention to her appearance - she's on the heavy side, and her hair is long with no style. One night, she stays late at the office, and a man, angry with one of the partners, comes in with a gun. She is killed. At the same moment of her death, a shallow, pencil thin, blonde beauty named Deb is driving to an audition to be a prize demonstrator on The Price is Right and crashes while putting on lipstick. Upset that she's dead, once in heaven, she hits a \"return\" button when the check-in person isn't looking. She ends up with Jayne's body, Jayne's brains, and her own memory.I love the premise - it's been used in movies before, but usually seriously. Some of the scenes are great, including when Deb first sees herself as Jayne, Jayne trying to get into Deb's clothes - I won't spoil it for you. Since Deb has inherited Jayne's brain power, she's thrilled that she's now smart, and certainly knows how to deal with competitive women, which Jayne did not. I love how Elliot incorporates Deb's bubbly personality beneath the person of Jayne.Very well cast, with Margaret Cho as Jayne's assistant and Kate Levering, a talented Broadway actress, as Deb's friend Kim.Great fun, and I'm so happy that Lifetime has been branching out from its women in jeopardy theme.",

    "top_review": "I liked Ghost Whisperer. I don't know how long it will last, but who can tell nowadays. (I figured Joan of Arcadia for a seven year run.)At least Jennifer Love Hewitt is back and she's not reprising Party of Five this time. She's chasing ghosts, which allows her to do everything she does well except sing. (She has a great voice. Started out singing in Texas at age 3. Maybe she'll meet a singing ghost somewhere along the way.)So it's Ghost Whisperer on CBS versus Medium on NBC and that may rankle Medium fans but Medium is on a different night and seems to be slowing down this season. I always tape Medium because it usually puts me to sleep in the last half-hour, despite the admirable talents of Patricia Arquette and Jake Weber and their wonderful TV kids Sofia Vassilieva and Maria Lark.It isn't Jennifer Love Hewitt versus Patricia Arquette in any case. These two actresses are as different as night and day in look, style and approach. Both total pros and completely capable of leading a series.I didn't like the Medium rip-off scene where a prophetic nightmare wakes Melinda (Jennifer Love Hewitt) in bed with her husband (David Conrad), but once you get past the obvious similarities GW goes way beyond Medium. Melinda doesn't depend on dreams. She sees ghosts everywhere, all the time. (The bedroom in Medium is that show's main set.)Ghost Whisperer is no Dead Zone and it's not jumping on the post-X-Files backlash bandwagon like Supernatural either. It's more Touched By An Angel (a similarity that Dead Zone exec producer Michael Piller specifically instructs his writers to avoid.)The Ghost Whisperer pilot did center entirely on Hewitt, but it's her show, after all. I wondered if they cut stuff out for time. References to what her husband does for a living were rather obviously thrown in as voiceovers until they briefly discussed his day as a paramedic, rather than showing him in action somewhere in the beginning to establish him.I liked that producer Hewitt pulled in character actors Eddie Jones (ex-Pa Kent from Lois & Clark, the Invisible Man's boss, etc) and Jon Polito and also Wentworth Miller (from Prison Break) as guest stars. (And was that June Lockhart as Melinda's grandma? Sure looked like her.) Wentworth Miller reminds me so much of Steve McQueen that I'm hooked on Prison Break, despite the limited nature of that plot line. And the scene where guest Balthazar Getty (as Michael Adams) told Melinda off was terrific.Anyway, there's no denying that Hewitt is beautiful and maturing as an actress. She has a great, expressive face. (I admit that the whole show could be shot in close ups and I'd probably still like it.) Modern former child actors like Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar and Seth Green knock me out because they always seem to know exactly what they're doing. They don't just stand around waiting while other actors deliver their lines. They're always \"on\".But Hewitt is more than just a pretty face. (She could have been a Charmed One after Shannen Doherty left, but turned down the role.) I say let's see what happens with Ghost Whisperer. It may just be the surprise hit of the season.",

There's no episode you ran a dialog like this: -oh how they beat me good i'm like reborn......2-Main characters problem M.Cemcir and A.Kural came to us as a inventor brothers.They got ideas like no physic professor can find.In the series we have no idea how this two guys could be scientists\\inventors.We didn't see them watching a documentary,we didn't see them reading a book or quoting from some science men in a conversation.Nothing!!They are typical unemployed neighborhood boys have suddenly an invention about ending oil problem on the earth plus save the environment.Probably they saw problem about that and after 10 episodes we learned they are not inventors they're just two guys who tries to improve they're father's invention by the way we learned after 10 episodes they're father was a retired physic professor.So I want to ask then why first 10 episodes they act like they've got an invention? plus even they're not inventors they must know great physics for improving invention.

    "top_review": "Tru Calling had a great premise, unlike anything else on TV at the time, and most episodes were interesting and mysterious. Eliza Dushku was in top form and had an excellent cast behind her, including Shawn Reaves as her wheeling, dealing brother Harrison. Everything fell into place on Tru Calling but it was on Fox which seems to be a curse for so many potentially good shows. I don't understand how so many bad shows manage to last so long while the few good ones that get on the air don't last much more than a season. Tru Calling now joins the ranks of some of the best shows that never got a fair chance: Firefly, Undergrads, Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared, and Clerks. In the years to come when more and more people discover these hidden gems they will wonder why some of the best TV from 99-04 got the axe while other shows that nobody will even be talking about got season after season. Perhaps the reason that TC didn't last so long is that it was too smart for the average viewer. It helps when you think about TC when your watching it. Tru Calling is not the pop song that so many other shows are, it is an opera filled with all sorts of layers. Tru Calling had such a good set up and did not get the chance follow through on its potential. There were so many amazing stories that they could have told if given the chance. If you have not seen Tru Calling and are on this page I suggest that you pick up the DVD sets as you'll end up going back to it time and time again. The best new show on TV in 2003/4 can be the best new show in your DVD collection, as it is in mine. Its too bad nobody could go back in time and save Tru Calling....... and Firefly and Undergrads and Clerks.........The candle that burns twice as bright lasts half as long.",

    "top_review": "I think I can make this comment short & sweet:In the new Nickelodeon teen comedy show \"Victorious,\" Tori Vega (Victoria Justice) enrolls at a prestigious performing arts school after taking her older sister's place in a singing contest and just absolutely wowing the audience, not to mention herself, with her singing abilities. Hilarity ensues as she tries to adjust to life at the school and learn to harness her talents in an artistic and professional manner. And we also get to know some of her friends and enemies at the school, all of whom are also quite likable and colorful, including a nerdy guy with a fast-talking puppet.Series creator Dan Schneider (\"All That,\" \"Zoey 101,\" \"Drake & Josh\" and my personal favorite, \"iCarly\") has yet another hit on his hands with his latest, \"Victorious,\" which is obviously meant to be the breakout role of star Victoria Justice, in her first starring role. I watched \"All That\" in the few precious years before Nickleodeon began its descent into idiocy in the late 1990s; I never watched \"Zoey 101,\" but I do remember Victoria Justice from the \"iCarly\" movie \"iFight Shelby Marx.\"One of Schneider's gifts as an entertainer is that he knows his audience and stars better than anyone else in the business. Being a former child actor himself, he knows his audience and empathizes with them and knows what works and what doesn't. He knows how to make his audience laugh without pandering to them or insulting their intelligence. Someone from a vastly different background making this show couldn't do what he does in making teen comedy shows funny, compelling, and continually interesting to watch.Being that I'm in my mid-20s, I grew up watching Nick when it was still in its prime in the mid-'90s, and many of its greatest-ever shows are no longer on the air, unfortunately, and have been relegated to mere childhood memories. Shows like \"iCarly\" and \"Victorious,\" in my opinion, are able to give this fledgling network some semblance of credibility in trying to reel in lapsed viewers from better days gone by. And this is why I'm continually impressed by \"iCarly\" and \"Victorious,\" because they're entertaining, sweet, innocent, and funny just like some of the older shows no longer on the air were back inthe day.Like Miranda Cosgrove in \"iCarly,\" Justice proves to be a spunky, fresh, and likable young talent to keep an eye on. And like some of her other peers, she can sing (how long will it be before she releases her first CD?). In my opinion, she and Miranda Cosgrove could definitely give other teen singing sensations of the moment like Miley Cyrus a run for their money.Although I'm only two episodes in, I know that Dan Schneider has another teen comedy success on his hands. Victoria Justice is primed to become another teen star like some of her other cohorts on other popular Nick shows. What I can say about this show is that it is indeed very funny, and Schneider and company definitely better keep up the good work, or else!10/10",

The characters are 3 dimensional and all sorts of religions and races are showcased.Some of the episodes are more intense than others, which is just like teen life. Sometimes horrible things happen, sometimes they don't. This show covers all ranges of topics, including teen pregnancy, abusive boyfriends and homosexuality. These are all topics that teens experience in high school, and there is no sugar-coating.My favourite character is Marco, and I feel he has really grown as a character. He started out as just another guy, but turned into a sensitive, sweet, and overall amazing guy.I definitely recommend teens watch this, but also parents. I know my mom loves watching it with me! What I don't recommend is anyone under 12 watching this. I have met people who just don't get it, and think it's gross or stupid because they are too young to comprehend what is going on. It is a great Canadian (yeah!!!) teen show. 9 stars out of 10. (I don't believe in anything being perfect, I think everything can be improved)",

    "top_review": "I think most people would agree, whether British or not, that Inspector Morse represents everything that is good about British television.  In January 1987, the first television episode of Colin Dexter's intelligent series of novels was broadcast.  Inspector Morse was perfect - the beautiful scenery of Oxford, the classic red Jaguar, the classical music and a superb, and at times moving, central performance by the man his co-star Kevin Whately would later describe, after his untimely death in 2002, as Britain's finest screen actor.  Until it finished in 2000, Inspector Morse captivated large audiences, intrigued by its complex plots, the towering performance of John Thaw and its amazing roll call of quality guest actors.  The series oozed class from every pore, and will always be the greatest jewel in the magnificent career of the late John Thaw.  I really cannot find enough words to explain just how good I think Thaw was in so many of his television and film roles, but Morse was the character in which he proved to television viewers that he was not only versatile but had a rare depth.The early episodes are certainly my favourites, as they were adapting the existing stories.  Later, as they ran out of Dexter's stories, they began writing stories to keep the popular series going.  But throughout, we learn more and more about the mysterious, emotionally repressed and rather sad Inspector.  Without doubt, this is the greatest modern murder mystery franchise, and the series so many have tried, and failed, to emulate since.",

Like WB now, Fox wanted to lure in a teenage audience with its good-looking young stars.  Luckily for those stars, 21 Jump Street was a rather good vehicle, and stood on its own merits.Kind of like a Mod Squad for the 80s, the \"teens\" in 21 Jump Street were cops.  Hip cops.  They would infiltrate schools, drug rings, gangs, wherever teenagers were in trouble... unlike the Mod Squad, though, the storylines were always passable, and quite often excellent.  Almost every episode touched upon subjects that were taboo for the big 3 networks (and still are)- AIDS, statutory rape, drug use, abortion, child abuse- and presented it in a moralistic way, but without being maudlin.The show kind of faltered in its last few seasons; Johnny Depp was becoming a star, and execs started pushing other \"stars\" into the spotlight, hoping for cash rewards and spin-offs.  Richard Greico was most heavily promoted, to an audience that didn't really care.  He became a teen-age heartthrob for a while, but never achieved the momentum to carry his career skyward. With this pushing of the stars, the storylines took a back seat to character preening.  The end result was faltering ratings, and cancellation.Until it became an actors' showcase, though, 21 Jump Street was probably the best drama on TV.",

I am always delighted for my preconceptions to be proved inaccurate and in this instance, it has proved to be the case (touch wood). The show begins weakly, with minimal background on the lead character and we are thrown in (literally) at the deep end. Having watched the whole episode, I can understand now why this is so. Obviously, the mysteries of Jason's origins are destined to be revealed over the course of the series. The sets are gorgeous, especially the scenes filmed in Morocco. The acting is almost uniformly first rate, with Mark Addy (The Full Monty) and Robert Emms in particular standing out. The excellent Alexander Siddig (Deep Space Nine, Syriana) also appears, but his role in the first episode is small. I am sure that will change in future episodes. He is too good to waste on a minor part. This is good, old fashioned swords and monsters escapism done very well. Anyone looking for deeper meanings or historical accuracy will be sorely aggrieved, but that is very far from the point. This show could be everything that Merlin promised, but ultimately failed to deliver. If the rest of the series is anywhere as much fun, I will be watching Atlantis for a long time to come. Take a look and give it 15 minutes before you give up on it. It really picks up in a big way. Well done, BBC!",

Andy tries hard to fix things, be it a local marriage, the town's awareness of STDs, or his less than perfect relationship with his son, Ephram, played by Gregory Smith. Ephram, a gifted pianist, has his own troubles to deal with... notably his \"new guy\" status and the connection he makes with Amy Abbot, daughter of his father's medical rival and girlfriend of the local 'Mr. Popular'.All in all, the series plays out wonderfully. The lush setting of Everwood keeps it far from the fancy glitz often seen in today's television, and gives the show a home feel to it. The developing characters weave together a complete picture of the mountain town. A place where everyone knows one another, and community is hard to avoid.In my personal opinion, Everwood is one of the best shows on television today. With as much emphasis as there is being put on bright lights and big city, it is refreshing to find a down to earth realistic show that doesn't scream for attention through forced drama and scandalous plot.Personal rating: 10/10",

    "top_review": "Rarely has a TV show so gripped the world as Batman did way back in 1966.  People still remember this incredibly campy show and watch it.  The show was based on a twenty-year-old comic strip names Batman.  In fact the show was credited for saving the dying Bat comic strip from extinction.  However the campy tone makes many of the Bat fans angry that this show supposedly set a too campy tone for comic book today.I think the show did have some bad points especially in the second season but this was still a great show.  Adam West was a near perfect Batman, Burt Ward was hilarious as Robin.  Neil Hamilton was an excellent Commissioner Gordon and Stafford Repp was excellent as Chief O'Hara.  Also Alfred the Butler was played excellently by Alan Napier.  Together they would fight the forces of evil in Gotham City with a series of excellent cops, honesty, a man in a six foot bat suit and a series of sound effects that would attack villains toward the end of a thirty minute cycle.The show was campy but all comic books before Batman were.  The show had some distinctly satirical overtones and why shouldn't it.  A millionaire dresses up as a bat to fight crime?  These days the millionaire is more likely to be committing the crime.  The episodes at the beginning of the shows short run and the episodes at the  end of the shows run were indeed the best and a few of them were some of the noted best episodes any any television show period.  At the beginning of 1966 everything turned Batman.  The TV show dominated television, merchandising an advertisement for the show even made it to the Super Bowl!  The show even was made into a theatrically released movie.  The show lost almost all of it's edge when the second season came and the show went from being satirical and over the top to just too campy.The villains were great as well.  Top name celebrities lined up to star in this show.  John Wayne, Spencer Tracy, Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lewis and other top named celebrities lined up to star in this show, many of them never got the chance.  But some of these people were just great.  Frank Gorshin as the Riddler, Julie Newmar as Catwoman, Cesar Romero as the Joker and Burgess Meredith as the Penguin are now legendary.  There were many others but those were arguably the four most well known.Burgess Meredith was always my favorite.  He was such a great actor in real life.  Frank gorshin's excellent job as the Riddler brought the Riddler in the comic books from being a minor villain to one of the top villains.  My favorite episode of the series were the ones where The Penguin ran for mayor.  These were just so many great moments in that one, watching Allen Ludden comment on the fight between Batman and the Penguins goons were hilarious.  My second favorite episodes were where the Joker went surfing and planned to win taking over the surfers.  That was classic.I found it interesting that in this show everyone was helpful, the only bad guys were the villains and everyone who was not a villain was misguided and the villains were really goofy instead of evil.  Everyone was basically decent.  People that lived during that time said it was like that even outside of television.  I like the comic strips of Batman and the show because it is supposed to show everyone in a good light and show everyone's good side.     Many comic book people say this show is awful.  This is the original Batman on television, and if there was not this there would be no movies there may not even be a series of comic books as this show regenerated interest in the comic strip even Bob Kane said so.  All I can say is this is classic television.  It is without a doubt hilarious and a great tribute to the series.",

'Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law' is a case in point. I don't know if it achieved any kind of audience in the US, but it suddenly appeared out of nowhere here in Australia and was shown at an odd time slot with little fanfare. A friend caught the Scooby Doo episode and when he described it to me, I knew this was a show I just HAD to see! So I managed to catch the \"Unabooboo\" episode, then the one where Jabbajaw and The Neptunes are accused of plagiarism, and last night I watched the Flintstones/Sopranos episode, which was pure genius! I am now hooked for life! For anybody who hasn't seen the show it features Birdman the 60s Hanna Barbera cartoon character reinvented as Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law. Each episode he defends a cartoon client accused of some crime e.g. Shaggy and Scooby Doo for dope, Fred Flintstone for racketeering. Plus there are lots of strange gay in-jokes and surreal bits and pieces which make it one of the most demented things I've seen since vintage 'Ren and Stimpy'. My favourite characters are Reducto and Birdman's nutty eye-patch wearing boss. This is an utterly brilliant show and I can't wait to see more episodes!",

I like the way they have taken the era in which the original Washington Irving story takes place, which gives a nod to the man and story itself and skillfully brings it into the modern day. Sleepy Hollow blends in elements of magic, horror and mystery. The production values are great, the casting and acting also spot on and I love the creative license they have taken with the story. It's crazy, fun and full of surprises. One of which I really like, is the apocalyptic angle. I also really like the supernatural aspect of it, I'd love to go into more detail, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't watched it yet. I'm glad to see the networks finally embracing genres like horror -\"The Walking Dead\" is a great example of how, if done well, and taken seriously, a genre TV show can be a big hit with a large demographic. I'm certain I'm not alone in being over the so called \"reality TV\" which is neither reality nor proper TV. I'm also sick and tired of the endless cop procedural's that seem to dominate network TV. It's time for new ideas, even if they come from old stories. If they keep up the good writing, develop the characters properly, keep high production values and hold onto the show runner for more than one season without replacing them, I can easily see this show be a success.",

    "top_review": "Here's how you can tell, (sort of), which season a rerun of this show was originally part of. Most of us watch the reruns even more than the regular show and even discovered the regular show through the re-runs so I thought this might be helpful for the newbies.1988: The pilot has a grainy look to it. The offices of the lawyers are more proletarian that the wood-paneled hives they now work in. The big thing is that the DA, (as opposed to the Executive Assistant DA- let's call him the EADA, or the assistant DA- let's call her the ADA), is played for the one and only time by Roy Thinnes, who must have finally escaped from 'The Invaders'. It's about the Masucci Crime Family, (who will be back), corrupting public officials and ends will a lengthy scroll about the ongoing fight against corruption, etc.1990-91: Short, heavy-set, balding George Dzundza is the cynical older cop. Dzundza left because he preferred to live and work where it was warmer and his character, (played by his stand-in), gets bumped off in the first episode of the second season.1991-92: Paul Sorvino plays his replacement, nice-guy Phil Cerretta. The show actually began the next year with the same cast but Sorvino wanted to leave to become an opera singer so poor Phil got shot by a black-market arms dealer in November, 1992 and was replaced by the classic dog-faced flatfoot, Jerry Orbach as Lenny Briscoe. 1993-94: It had been an all-male cast so they brought in Jill Hennessy to replace Richard Brooks as the ADA. But Brooks was black so they had to bring in another black character, (my interpretation) so out went the excellent Dann Florek as Lt. Cragan, to be replaced by S. Epatha Merkerson, (I can always remember her name but not the characters).1994-5: Michael Moriarity had come apart due to, (from what I've read), alcohol and chronic mental problems that resurfaced. He was replaced this season by Sam Waterson, who came over from 'I'll Fly Away' as the EADA. Meanwhile perennial malcontent, (again from what I've read), Chris Noth either wanted out or was wanted out and his character, Mike Logan, slugs another corrupt public official on the steps of the courthouse, (after the smug perp gets off), and is banished to Staten Island, later to return in a TV movie. 1995-96: The year of the first true 'Homicide' cross-over, (Noth as Logan had done a cameo the previous year), and the rare L&O episode that was about the regulars, who witnesses an execution and then spend the day and night drinking it off. It all ends with Hennessy's character, Clare Kincaid, dying in an auto accident. RIP.1996-98 Carey Lowell replaced Hennessy. Dick Wolf had apparently decided to get ready for the next abrupt departure by creating a sub-plot for each character to explain why they might leave: Adam Schiff was facing a tough election, (and his wife was dying), McCoy was up on ethics charges, (finally). Jaime Ross's sleazy ex-husband was trying to win custody of their child by claiming she was working too hard. Van Buren was suing the city for discrimination in promotions. Lenny Briscoe's daughter gets rubbed out by a dope ring. Rey Curtis' wife has MS. So what happened? Nothing. Everyone stayed.1998-99: Lowell DID leave, for a similar reason as her character's- she had a baby with Richard Gere and wanted to spend time with her child. Angie Harmon, a real firecracker, came in to replace her.1999-00: Bratt left to spend more time with HIS movie star other half, Julia Roberts, (it didn't last). Jesse Martin replaced him.2000-01: Hill finally left to be replaced with Diane Wiest.2001-02: Harmon left to be with her new hubby, football star Jason Sehorn, to be replaced by the much maligned, (and under-rated), Elizabeth Rohm. 9/11 made it an interesting season to come in. 2002-04: Senator Fred Thompson replaces Wiest.2004-05: By bye Lennie Briscoe. Hello Dennis Farnia. Does it even matter that his character's named Fontana? Sooo\u0085Thinnes= '88 pilot. Dzundza = 1st season (90-91). Sorvino = 2nd season or early third, (91-92). Orbach reporting to Florek = 3rd season, (92-93). Moriarity working with Hennessy = 4th season, (93-94). Waterson and we still have Noth= 5th season, (94-95). Bratt and we still have Hennessy = 6th season, (95-96). Carey Lowell is either the 7th season, (96-97) or 8th season, (97-98). Harmon and we still have Bratt = 9th season (98-99). Martin and we still have Hill = 10th season, (99-00). Wiest working with Harmon = 11th season, (00-01). Wiest working with Rohm = 12th season, (01-02). Thompson and we still have Orbach = 13th, (02-03) or 14th, (03-04) season. Farina, so far = 15th season, (04-05).My dream cast? I'll take the crusty but forceful Thompson over the merely crusty Hill as the DA. I like Moriarity's Stone somewhat more than Waterson's McCoy. They are two of the finest actors of their generation but I prefer Stone's idealism to McCoy's 'winning is everything' attitude. Actually, I wish the series had both of them and had them alternated, with their different approaches. Hennessy's intelligent sensitivity and expressive face made her the best ADA. Florek is the classic middle manager who gets it from both sides. Orbach fits like an old glove. Noth's emotionalism made him more exciting that the other young cops. There was never a season when they were all together but the fourth season, 1993-94 was about the best.",

    "top_review": "I am really taken aback that the only comment I see so far for this excellent show is entirely negative and dismissive. I feel compelled to set the record straight. The commentator dismisses the show for, among other things, anachronistic historical inaccuracy, as well as politically correct emotional sterility. That is ridiculous. This was a wonderful show. The episodes were certainly not all the same. It dealt with many issues that are politically and socially relevant. It presented emotionally gripping drama, with different points of view, especially including compassionate consideration of the plight of native American people. It reminded me very much of the show Kung Fu, which is set during the same period in American history, the 1870s, and also had similar themes of pacifism, labor militancy, feminism, the plight of native Americans as well as the Chinese immigrants. (In actuality, David Carradine himself, a good friend of the Director and Seymour's husband, James Keatch (brother to Stacy Keatch, who appeared in one episode as President Ulysses Grant), appears in one of the episodes. The Keatches and the Carradines go back at least to the time when both families did the movie on the Younger-James gang.) This show won an AWARD from the Smithosonian institution, hardly a left-wing bastion of political correctness, for its portrayal of the massacre of the Cheyenne at Washita. Its portrayal of the history of the persecution and genocide of the native Americans, by such notorious b******s as Chivington and Custer, was meticulously researched. Its show on Walt Whitman is a case in point as a study of actual attitudes, scientific as well as popular, toward homosexuality, during this period. The show presented well the CENTRAL cultural conflict in American history, as portrayed by such authors as Leslie Fiedling (LOVE AND DEATH IN THE AMERICAN NOVEL) and Richard Slotkin (RESURRECTION THROUGH VIOLENCE): between the murderous drive to conquer nature and exterminate the \"Reds,\" vs. those, like Dr. Quinn, Sully, and their family, who seek, then as now, to make peace with their fellow human beings and the natural environment. The show emphasized the value of an emotionally, politically, and socially complex community, with its racial and ethnic hierarchies which Doctor Quinn continually challenged, and its emotional intimacies among men and women. Absolutely historically accurate! Last but certainly not least, the romantic aspects of the show: the growing romance between Dr. Quinn and Byron Sully, her adopted son Matthew and first Ingrid, and then the prostitute (what was her name?), and between her daughter. Caroline, and the Doctor, Andrew, were great: as was the portrayal of Matthew's coming of age as first the non-violent sheriff of the town, and then as a budding attorney. Please, if you have never seen this show before, do not be dissuaded by the previous commentator. Check it out-you'll be doing yourself a big favor. This is one of the best shows ever made for television!",

When I first saw the trailers and accompanying hype, I steered clear of it as it looked like yet another teen programme. But then I watched the second episode, about Cassie the anorexic, and was hooked. It managed to be both funny and touching - so much so that I cried at the end.It's a lot like Teachers in its sense of humour, and it has its location, Bristol, in common with Teachers. It's a shame it isn't on at an earlier time, as the script is wonderful and the characters so well drawn. Plus the performances by the young cast are extremely professional.I think good drama appeals to all ages, and I'm light years outside the target demographic for this. So I'd like to encourage the more mature viewer to give it a go - especially if you were a fan of Teachers - and you won't regret it.9 out of 10 as it's the most entertaining and, unfortunately, realistic youth drama to appear on the telly since As If.",

    "title": "Samurai Jack", 
    "critic_rating": "8.4", 
    "top_review": "A few years prior to this day, I had yet to take a single glimpse on Samurai Jack. For some time, I heard people raving about its outstanding animation techniques, never seen before fighting sequences and humor. Curiosity and anxiety surrounded my mind, wondering if it really reached or even surpassed the standards set by Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls. Incidentally, Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of this new show, has worked on the previous two before and based on my knowledge, his vision upon the animation industry is pretty unlike anything any other animators have seen before.Not long after its first run, I managed to witness an episode of Samurai Jack on Cartoon Network in my aunt's house. In fact, in my first viewpoint, the show really seemed a bit simplistic, focused more on battles and at some points, a sense of humor to keep the audience's interest. Yes, it bears similarity to other Genndy's older works. However, I'm just talking to one of the episodes shown on the channel. Initially, the similarity ended when I began to watch the rest of the episodes.The plot itself is quite simple: Samurai Jack (his original Japanese name remains a mystery) lives in ancient Japan where his homeland is being ravaged by a mightily powerful but weird-looking, sometimes insipid demon named Aku. Jack used his mystical sword to fight him and eventually he defeats him after a few bouts. But before Jack manages to destroy the demon once and for all, Aku casts a spell that sends Jack into the future, a time when Aku reigns supreme. Now, it is up to Jack to find a way to go back into the past by wandering around the futuristic cities, barren wastelands and ancient ruins inhabited by aliens and other bizarre creatures you haven't seen before and most importantly, meeting allies and friends (like the crazed muscular Scotsman) to give our struggling hero spiritual hope and motivation to reach his destiny (the maturity of Jack can be seen throughout the seasons, as he seems to be more confident and has the right to call himself 'The Legendary Samurai'. Something like that). The character designs and the environments are extremely odd in Genndy's favor but perhaps these are the reasons why Samurai Jack is such an appealing show to watch at. Firstly, unlike the typical Saturday cartoons we usually see, it is almost an ambiguous cartoon with really abstract elements (specially when you watch a peculiar episode for the first time ever). You have absolutely no idea what is going on there: the creatures, the aliens, the bizarre skyscrapers, the contraptions. They are all refreshingly cubic and bizarre and yet have a reason for their existence. Despite its subtle and uneven premise, Samurai Jack is simply a straightforward action show with easily identifiable objects (toon experts will know that for sure) and characters (its basic concept is mostly derived from the Star Wars universe, in which Genndy also directs under the name Clone Wars). At one case, some of the elements of Samurai Jack are derived from Akira Kurosawa's movies, anime (both state-of-the-art or clich\u00e9) and on another point, famous American icons and world cultures. Some even serve as a precursor to Craig McCracken's Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with bits and pieces from Dexter's Lab and PPG. Sure, most of the episodes don't capture the scope of full-length movies but the slowness of its nature allows the audience to accept the fact that it almost feels like a movie, in a shorter form at least. If you ask whether the show's appropriate for kids, well, Samurai Jack is a surprisingly violent cartoon (that's beyond the boundary of Dex and PPG) but that otherwise proves that Genndy's skills to handle a particular context has matured.What really fascinate me are Genndy's abilities to master the essential film-making techniques such as pace, flow, mise-en-scene and mood, smooth animation and most importantly, character appeal such as Samurai Jack himself. Some sequences are even squeezed in to a particular ratio aspect to provide a cinematic point of view as well as to increase the tension of a situation. Creative editing techniques also helps to build anticipation, fasten the pace of the action sequences (mostly beautifully choreographed despite the fact that they are just frames of drawings!) and create decisive matters as Jack faces frequent pandemonium. The artwork of the show is equally impressive albeit a bit kiddy oriented. That essentially leads to one of Genndy's strongest trademarks and principles: simplistic designs tend to have greater impact compared to realistic models (of 2D and 3D) by conveying constant exaggeration, ridiculous laws of physic and common sense and doses of good slapstick humor while maintaining its 'logical sense' without losing direction. The show's crystal clear colors and tones also manage to reflect the overall mood of a particular environment, whether you can feel the serenity of ancient Japan or the unknown danger of the dark and barren wasteland.If it weren't for Genndy, cartoons cannot evolve into newer forms. If Gene Deitch gave birth to 'limited animation' via Gerald McBoing Boing, we all could say that, in my opinion, Genndy Tartakovsky gave birth to 'cinematic limited cartoons' or simply, 'Cinematic Toons'. I know these terms don't sound right to some people but through Samurai Jack, he has created something that proves to be revolutionary since the era of the Renaissance (Batman, DuckTales and Tiny Toons). Since then, Genndy Tartakovsky is now regarded as one of my most favorite 'heroes' of our time!",

Laugh at us!\" I watched an episode of All That on tape from 1995, then caught a new one from 2005. The differences are vast and very big. The 2005 All That episode was filled with unfunny sketches, and actors and actresses who were basically trying waaaaaaaaaay to hard to be funny and not succeeding in the least. (It's pretty much the same thing as the god awful \"Amanda Show\".) At least the 1995 version had funny sketches like Good Burger and such.Overall, avoid the All That of now like the plague, but try and hunt down the older episodes if you can.",

    "top_review": "\"Avrupa Yakasi\" means \"European Side\", which refers to the common usage of west side of Istanbul, since the big metropolis is divided into two by the Istanbul Strait, while eastern part is called \"Anatolian Side\".However in this funny sitcom by ATV, \"Avrupa Yakasi\" is the name of a Fashion & Style Magazine, which the main characters work for. The office of the magazine and almost all of the characters live in \"Nisantasi\", located in the European side of Istanbul. It is an important detail for this TV series, because \"Nisantasi\" is presented as the home town of \"high society\" in Istanbul.Since the story is about the high society or the \"White Turks\", who are educated and successful in their career, but also funny and romantic, sometimes feels like the characters are taken from similar American productions like \"Sex and the City\", \"Ally McBeal\" etc.Maybe for balancing these characters with Turkish reality or because of Istanbul, which is a melting pot, a city of great contrast, we have some completely contrary characters somehow found them in \"Nisantasi\". This opposition creates ridiculous atmosphere and many possibilities for funny rivalry between sides.Since the story is usually established on the colorful life of high society that we can describe them as \"European Side\"; watchers also surprised and amused by the opposite characters that can be described as the \"Anatolian Side\", sometimes because of their naive and unexpected behaviors, and sometimes because of very smart but short term solutions that they found to problems.\"Avrupa Yakasi\" is one of the most successful TV series of last year. Almost every character has created own fans. However \"Gulse Birsel\" who is the leading actress and also the writer of the script, and \"Ata Demirer\" who is a former comedian, made \"Avrupa Yakasi\" a phenomenon and created the major difference among other Turkish sitcoms.",

Aside from the fully historically accurate costumes and locations, the show is just gorgeous to look at. The lighting, the cinematography, and everything else visual about it is on point. It's quite apparent none of that money went to waste.The show doesn't just look gorgeous, though. It is also compelling, well written, and well performed. In fact, almost every element is perfectly executed, which means that no single one stands out above the rest, but rather they work in harmony. And that is the show's greatest success; the fact that it all comes together smoothly into a neat, binge-able, high quality package.Mind you, the reason I enjoy the Crown so much is that I knew what to expect when I went into it. This is NOT a fast-paced, action-packed, edge-of-your-seat experience. It is a character drama about the royal family. It runs at a slow pace. Yet it is gripping all the same. That's why it is so good to know that Netflix made such a large investment in this series; they're taking chances and funding original and unusual things in an era when Hollywood is afraid to do anything that isn't already an existing intellectual property.

But in Boss we find Mayor Tom Kane (Grammar) as a man who is already powerful, has estranged all of those whom he loves, and has abandoned and abrogated his morals and conscience to get where he is. Then, a life-changing piece of news sets him on a path to contrition.What happens as this powerful \"Boss\" begins to allow his humanity to surface again? Can he keep his grip on power as he begins to show the 'milk of human kindness' again? Shades of Tony Soprano balancing his shadow side and sensitive, loving side in this powerfully-themed (and acted) series.And if the Macbeth-in-reverse comparison weren't enough, there is a \"King Lear\" like pathos to the man who has estranged his daughter who chose the path of compassionate poverty even as Dad was ruling the city with an iron fist. The faltering attempt at reconciliation here adds yet another rich texture to a compelling series sure to grow more and more powerful. THe scope is ambitious, as it explores the dynamics of the modern city-state, much as \"The Wire\" ambitiously attempted (and succeeded at).Emotionally powerful, dark, compassionate, visceral and a paean to what makes life significant (no explanations... you'll see), this series is as full an orchestra of art as has been seen on television since the likes of The Wire and The Sopranos.",

    "top_review": "Let me just start by saying that I love paranormal shows and this is by far, the best one I've seen. If you don't like paranormal or don't believe in it, then why are you watching it? For entertainment? Fine. You'll be entertained. Otherwise, what's the point of watching a show you hate?Anyway, the reason I started watching GA was because of the Viscilla Axe Murder House. I was a little put off by the men's attitudes at first because that might be the most disturbing thing I've ever researched; it stays with you long after you hear about it and yet, none of the guys were showing any sign of sadness or sympathy for the victims. Then I realized that's just the sensitive girl in me (they can't walk around sobbing now can they? That's just unproductive) so I stopped and listened and before I knew it, I was completely hooked.Until I saw that episode, I was an avid Ghost Hunters fan. Yet, comparing the two (and you can't help but to compare them) I can see why so many people have switched to GA; their passion really drives their curiosity of the unknown while with GH, it just seems like a hobby. I could be totally wrong about that, but that's how it comes across.One thing I really appreciate is that the camera crew are also the hosts- and there's only 3 of them! They don't have teams which decreases the chance of contamination, which makes their evidence more solid. Often times during GH, I would wonder if it were the cameramen or sound guys making a sound and not admitting to it but with GA, you don't have to guess because their cameras are often trained on each other; Zak is talking to Nick's camera while Aaron is filming Nick. The guys are quite the characters too.Aaron is the dramatic one. He can be over the top sometimes and is certainly the most jumpy out of the 3. He can often break the intensity of the situation with a simple open mouth gasp and it can either be annoying or hysterical. He seems timid when in a group setting, like he's more frightened by his co-hosts than the ghosts.Nick is the experimental one (he's also known as the \"Runner\" from my friends because of his history of running when things got scary). At the risk of sounding childish, he's definitely my favorite one to listen to. By that, I mean compared to Zak's forceful voice, his is quiet but confident and he can provoke the spirits just as well. You can tell he likes being by himself as it gives him the freedom of having one on one contact with something paranormal-friendly or not. He's the perfect middle between Aaron's dramatics and Zak's ferocity; he's the calm between two storms essentially.Zak is the leader. Despite his tough exterior, Zak has shown on many occasions that he has quite the sense of humor (for proof, see their Valentine's Day special). He's also gotten extremely emotional during some experiences- not crying, thank God- but they certainly add to overall effect of what I'm seeing. It wouldn't be the same if they have stoic faces during a terrifying EVP session or physical contact. He's the anchor of the show and without him and his tiny shirts, it just wouldn't be the same.Sure, these guys can sound like they stepped into Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure but in a way, it works. It tells me that these are average guys who have a passion for something and they followed it. The learn experience from on the job and watching their first documentary to their latest episode, you can really tell how much they've grown from their experiences.Those things being said, there are 2 things that bug me: 1) they don't show much debunking. That doesn't mean they don't do it, because they tell you if it's something non paranormal but I wished they did more debunking in general. Especially with banging and sounds. 2) Zak said on one case, that they don't like to get religious on cases, which I completely understand, but if you're going to say something's demonic...that's religious; \"holy\" water will do as much good as an umbrella during a tidal wave.Of course, like any show that has the paranormal in it, you pretty much have to take their word for things. Are these guys trustworthy? If you don't think so, then at least you can be entertained for an hour.",

The series may be slow at first, but give it three to four episodes and you'll be hooked. With a cast that gets better with age, writing that goes from zany and out of this world to surprisingly profound and sweet, and a stellar sense of humor, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is the kind of series that improves over time, much like Ms. Fey's first sitcom. The cast includes a zesty Carol Kane, the funny as always Jane Krakowski, 30 Rock Guest alum Tituss Burgess, and our lead Ellie Kemper; these four hilariously colorful players take the normal NBC formula for comedy and make it into something far smarter and much sharper. The writing also manages to succeed beyond my expectations. As a HUGE fan of 30 Rock, I know Ms. Fey can write up a storm. However, I thought it was the comedian perception of Television that made it so fresh. No\u0085 it's her perception of diversity and identity and all their wonderfulness that makes this show work so well. As I mentioned earlier, the show is funny yes, but also much deeper than the common person will perceive. I'm glad to know that Netflix went for the full two seasons, for this show demands at least that many to get into its full rhythm. Remember, 30 Rock wasn't a masterpiece till season 3\u0085 I can't wait to see where the shows is when it hits its third season\u0085 and trust me\u0085 there will be a 3rd season.",

    "top_review": "After reading another comment about this show being a rip-off of six feet under I'd like to comment.I've seen every episode of six feet under and consider myself an avid fan. The main differences are not hard to determine. Six feet under is a show that centers around a dysfunctional family in the wake of their own tragedy.(Death of the father). The way the series has played out makes the fact that they own a funeral home unimportant. Great drama is always about the characters. Six feet under is no exception. There are various story arcs that play out over the course of each season. Some stories carry over to the next season to keep you watching. It is very original.Dead like me on the other hand is a fresh perspective of how the human dead are handled in the grand scheme of things. The idea that there is an entire sub-culture of un-dead following orders to take care of the mundane task of reaping a soul and showing the dead folks the way to the other side is comical but also makes you wonder \"hmm... who's to say this doesn't occur? It also centers on Georgia Lass (freshly dead after a toilet seat from a de-orbiting space station takes her life)and how she handles the dubious distinction of becoming a reaper. Now in its second season, it again is focusing not on the occupation of those in the show, but the characters in the occupation of reaping. We are starting to get a glimps of the lives of Roxy, Rube, Daisy et al before they became reapers. I think Ellen Muth and Mandy Patankin are fantastic. I also like every last supporting character. It's superbly written and actually make you think about life in a different light. If you've not seen the show, at least give it a chance. Now if HBO came out with a show called \"Gay as Family\",(their version of Queer as folk) then I'd be screaming rip-off. Never forget Death happens to everyone eventually. There is surely room for more than one show that focuses on it.Watch and be entertained,",

Drawn Together is a very sharp, tongue-in-cheek, parody show that isn't for the faint of heart viewer. This is gross, disgusting comedy, and i love every minute of it. It makes fun of other shows, but puts its own spin on it. You've seen a lot of the skits and jokes from somewhere else, but it seems so fresh and new in here. The writer ain't afraid to push the envelope to. When you see the episode about Clara's cursed genitals you'll understand.All the characters are great and they spend time on them all. Ling-ling is just crazy, Clara is so flaky, foxy so independent, Captain Hero so naive, Spanky ham is the only one above thirty, Toot is one back-stabbing bitch, Wooldoor is there for laughs, and Xander is so gay but he's always trying to save his girlfriend.This isn't for many people, but if it tickles your fancy than you wont be disappointed.

    "top_review": "I've lived in Mexico for a few years and grew up watching various anime. For some reason, many of them such as Dragonball weren't as popular in the US and many European countries back then. It's only since the turn of the century that this franchise hit the US. I stopped watching the series years ago. This has mainly to do because I didn't really like the English dub of DBZ with lot's of cuts and a complete new soundtrack. It's just recently that I rediscovered the whole franchise through the internet and my conclusion is that these original series from the DB trilogy are actually much better than DBZ.If you don't like DBZ & DBGT or think they Jumped the Shark at some point, it's probably due to one of these reasons: -The characters grew ridiculously strong and got stronger every minute. -The battles became long and monotonous. -Too much time was wasted in having people stare at each other explaining the plot which wasn't always that interesting.-The villains got too far fetched (Majin Buu is a great example).-Several characters lost its importance.-You don't like these kind of anime at all.Except if it's the last one, I think you're probably going to prefer the original DB cause most of these aspects weren't nearly as exaggerated. This show is in its essence an adventure story based on an old Chinese tale called A Journey to the West. It revolves, in this case, around several martial artists so it does contain a lot of fights. What differentiates this show from its successors is that, since this is where it all began, none of the characters were too Godlike to start with. The fights were therefore not only way shorter (a few episodes at max) but also funnier and more interesting. It wasn't all about who's the strongest one? The reason why I prefer DB above DBZ is almost the same one as why I never really liked the English dubbed DBZ. It really became too over the top at one point and I felt like they tried to make the show cooler than it already was. Another characteristic that DBZ and DBGT lacked is the atmosphere. Most of this anime takes place in a fictional type of China with a plot which belonged to the fantasy genre. In DBZ however, it switched over to science fiction and most of the fights took place in open fields. The last aspect is the characters. Of course, Goku is the protagonist, but this series also introduced a lot more iconic characters with all unique aspects. The antagonists on the other hand were also much more interesting since most of the weren't actually \"super villains\". At the beginning you had Pilaf who was basically a comic relief followed by the Red Ribbon army containing several kinds of bad guys and ending up with Piccolo Daimaoh who, up to date, is my favourite DB villain.I still like DBZ but sometimes I really wonder whether it would've been better for them to quit much earlier because I was a bit disappointed by the way it ended.One other thing. It's only now when I realize that this anime is definitely not meant for little children, it's meant for everyone who likes anime. Some parts, I enjoy more than I used to because of the mature sense of humour. If you want to watch it, look for uncut versions.",

American TV would never have a character like this - they always make the sitcom people likable and \"we have to want to root for them\" and all that other bland stuff. A classic U.S. sitcom in the 80's - Buffalo Bill with Dabney Coleman was so outside the box from what had appeared on broadcast TV that they didn't know what to do with so they axed it. (His character too was a local Morning Show host in Buffalo, NY with an ego the size of Earth and total scum to everyone around him) and of course Larry David tries to pull it off on Curb Your Enthusiasm - and yes, even though the show is funny - David is very limited as an \"actor\" and Coogan is not.

    "top_review": "Anthony Hopkins can be proud of having created one of the first original horror characters of the postwar era. His Dr. Hannibal \"The Cannibal\" Lecter has rightfully earned a place in the pantheon of legendary monsters. Hopkins was only the second actor to have won an Academy Award for playing a villain, the first being Fredric March for his remarkable performance in the rarely-seen \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (1931). The American Film Institute lists Hopkins' Lecter as the #1 screen villain in movie history.When I first heard about \"Hannibal\" the TV series, I cringed. Each installment in the film franchise had been exponentially worse than the one before. After Ridley Scott, Brett Ratner, Peter Webber--and even Thomas Harris himself--had tortured Hannibal near to death with their increasingly idiotic sequels to \"Silence of the Lambs,\" a TV series seemed like the sad, humiliating final nail in the doctor's coffin. Would this be \"Dexter\" redux, or another numbingly unoriginal CSI ripoff? Or worse, a tedious 5-season story arc following the personal trials of a young, idealistic, ruggedly handsome, perfectly stubbled Lecter as he spends 65 television hours' worth of time that I will never get back transitioning from noble psychiatrist to vengeful but justified killer? (Note to self: cock hammer, place barrel against temple, pull trigger.) Thankfully, \"Hannibal\" is everything I expected it not to be.I wasn't sure Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen--or any actor, for that matter--could play such an iconic character without being overshadowed by its grand progenitor (i.e., Hopkins), however \"Hannibal\" is so beautifully written, acted and directed that it transcends the inevitable comparisons. Hopkins played Lecter with hellish glee. He was the serial killer as prankster, a thinking man's Joker without the facial scars. Mikkelsen's Lecter is quieter and deadlier. He's almost like an alien predator, or a velociraptor in human form. When he smiles, you're probably about to die. Mikkelsen is chilling, funny, and blazingly brilliant. He totally makes the role his own, but that's not to take anything away from Anthony Hopkins. Asking who makes the better Lecter is like asking who's the best Dracula, Lugosi or Lee. They're both great, they're just different.I dislike police procedurals. They bore me. But \"Hannibal\" is different. There's something special about it. Bryan Fuller respects the characters and he understands the fans. He's given Lecter his first legitimate resurrection since \"Silence of the Lambs,\" and I am completely hooked. (And to think that we still have Eddie Izzard and Gillian Anderson to look forward to!)Fantastic show. High kudos to NBC for having the courage to air it.",

Rookie blue is exactly what you think it is: a cop show. It's got action, drama, and even has it's comedic moments. It has a variety of characters, the main ones being the five rookies, and chronicles the goings-on in and around the team. The main characters are Andy, the good cop who rarely lets anyone in, Epstein, the smart dork from a broken family (that he never really talks about), Peck, the mean girl whose mother was a well-known and well-respected cop on the force, Diaz, the good Catholic boy who seems to want to break free of that image, and Nash, the single mother who's been trying to balance work and motherhood without anyone's help. They're all, at times, naive and still have so much to learn but isn't that what being a rookie is all about? You're trained according to what might happen but that almost never completely prepares you for the real world. I think the problem many viewers have with this show is that it's been done before but, like I said , this is a cop show and that's what it's promised to be. If you know you don't like the genre, that's fine, but it isn't the show's fault. I'm venting a bit, but it's just frustrating when the advice being given is to not give the show a chance because there have been similar shows before. If you're looking for something completely different from anything you've ever seen before, you'll be looking for quite some time so, in the meantime, give this show a chance. It has real characters: ones everyone can relate to in some way or another, and the stories continue to unravel every week. Each episode has stories of their own, but there are also overarching story lines that regular viewers can become attached to. It recently got renewed for a second season (Congratulations!), so it'll be around for a while. It really is a good show. The kind that I, personally, have been wanting to see but didn't expect in the summer (how often do good summer shows come on?). So, if you can, check it out.

    "top_review": "Of all the shows, I believe that \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" is the one with which I can most identify with, since I have surely seen every single episode at least a dozen times - and yet it STILL never gets tired! I cannot get sick of this show, and it's making me a bit disturbed! Just what is it that makes this show so continually appealing, even around seven years since its final episode? I'm not sure...it's certainly not just one element. Every part of this show is magic: the wonderful acting from all involved; the witty (and often painfully hysterical) one-liners and banter between characters; the hip, cool atmosphere; the music...it all perfectly fits into what has to be one of the most remarkable and well-made sitcoms of the '90s.I find myself shocked sometimes at the number of people who have totally forgotten about this show. Granted, it DID end in 1996, and obviously a lot has happened since then (most notably the skyrocketing music & film career of a certain lead star), but I mean, come on! This show is an undisputed classic! Who can forget the wild, crazy, and just plain amusing adventures we've had with Will Smith and the Banks family?There were times when I was just addicted to this show, I remember...it was a while back when the episodes were running in syndication every evening on TBS SuperStation...I can't believe how this show can always manage to crack me up. It's incredible. I've grown to love all these characters so much, and even now, I still wouldn't pass up an opportunity to watch yet another priceless rerun.I agree, though, that yes, a lot of the late, LATE episodes (around the second-last and final season) had their fair share of groans, and showed some glaring signs of tedium, but thankfully, the overwhelming positive qualities of the series tower over such minor flaws - including the mysterious re-casting of Aunt Vivian's role from Janet Hubert-Whitten to Daphne Maxwell Reid; the increasingly old-hat shtick of using the same stock footage whenever Jazz gets thrown out of the Banks residence for the umpteenth time; the cursed addition of a new cast member - little Nicky Banks (Ross Bagley), etc....It's not an entirely perfect show, certainly (but then - what show is?), and it has had its fair share of ups and downs in its moderately impressive run of six years. However, when all is said and done, in the end, this show can proudly stand on its own as a pop culture treasure. It has evolved from what seemed initially to be an awkward, cheesy, quaint little '80s/'90s Cosby rip-off to a mature, slick, and fabulously written/produced/directed program. Pure gold is what this show is. A truly underrated, and always entertaining, gem. \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" is one for the ages.",

There is just a reality that some people aren't willing to deal that after 50 years of our history being whitewashed through film and TV, we're finally starting to see the truth. David Milch has done his research and discovered the wonderfully bizarre contradiction of languages used in the old west. Watching the cast of Deadwood converse with a combination of old world English laced with profanity straight from the gutter is incredible and feels right for the first time. Where do people think our language came from? People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.Along with the incredible dialog and storytelling, David Milch has introduced possibly the greatest character to ever come to TV or film...Al Swearengen. Ian McShane plays Al with the same intense conviction and truth that the character himself lives by. In Al's world things are black and white and never apologizes for a second for living his life by a strict code of morals of his own making. I don't think we've ever seen a character go from crying after a mercy killing to watching a murder he orchestrated stone faced. This is indeed a special show that is continuing to pave the way for the facts of our history to finally be told with truth...Instead of the whitewashing we've seen our whole lives to make us feel better about ourselves.",

There are operas, soap operas, space operas, and now \"park operas\". Consider how difficult it must be to act improv style not only on the set, but to act \"in character\" during all media interviews and public engagements, as is the expectation. Not many actors would have the commitment or stamina to carry this through for the benefit of the production image. Mike Smith, who plays the character Bubbles, apparently can only wear the thick glasses for 15 minutes at a time without extreme fatigue.Let's consider the acting quality and skill. Would Deniro or Pacino make this a better series? No! The charm is in the rough edges, the improv, the humility, and the belief that these are low rung thugs. It is totally believable and a credit to the acting and direction.How is Canada or Nova Scotia being insulted if we recognize that this series is a parody and that we should not take it so seriously. According to the on-line polls I have viewed for TPB of the episodes to date, the average rating has been 9 out of 10. Most of those voting were from Canada followed by participants from the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. We should be proud that we have had an impact on others, especially on those outside of our country.

I decided on Susanna Clarke's massive, doorstop of a novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell. It was recommended with a glowing review by Neil Gaiman and that was a good enough recommendation for me. At over a thousand pages I thought that it would keep me company for the entire three weeks and more. After ten days I needed to find another book. It was the first book in years that I had been totally engrossed in and also one which has stayed with me for much longer than the ten days it took me to read it. I have championed this book wherever I've lived and it is certainly one of the top five books I've ever read. I'm not a huge fan of fantasy literature, finding most of it turgid and unreadable, but because Susanna Clarke grounds her fantasy firmly in its own reality it was totally original and unique, like nothing I'd ever read before or since, and so when I heard that it was being adapted for television I was at first excited then worried that they would mess it up. After watching the first episode I can now say that not only did the BBC NOT mess it up but it exceeded my expectations. It was brilliantly designed, capturing the the flavour of the book's feel and it was superbly cast - Eddie Marsan is good in anything he's in, and he perfectly captures Norrell's isolationist magician. Bertie Carvel, who I've never heard of, was the flibbertigibbet Jonathan Strange I imagined from the book and Marc Warren was suitably sinister as the Gentleman with the Thistledown Hair. A great start to a series that is going to get weirder and weirder as it goes on, if it continues to follow the book. Marvellous.",

I am looking forward to this show because I am sick and tired of the generic, pansy, overly formulaic, and frankly unfunny sitcom shows on network TV (and by this I don't mean My Name Is Earl, The Office, or Arrested Development, but of the Freddy, Dharma and Greg variety). This show will be a breath of fresh air and will give me a great night of comedy (Entourage, Lucky Louie and Tourgasm). I can't wait.Also, I'm sad to report that cast member Jim Norton might not make season 2 because of his battle with AIDS. I'm currently watching his puppy and refilling his broth bowl.

Bergerac, Inspector Morse and Frost have trained us to expect quirky, interesting shows with characters who become part of British culture.

A fish out of water, DI Richard Poole must handle the transition from safe, temperate London to the bright colours of a small French Caribbean island, St. Marie, and bring the essence of British policing to its very un-British environment.The show's funny, interesting and very addictive. The writing is great and the acting just perfect. Carr and John-Jules bring the underdog policeman to life in the time-honoured way (complaining whilst showing just how much more they know than their boss believes) and Miller plays the lost Brit abroad perfectly whilst adding that touch of off the wall brilliance that a British detective is meant to bring to a show. Martins adds a sparkling performance as his sidekick with a wonderfully wry view of the British policeman's inability to adapt to the island's lovely lifestyle.This show's one to watch and one I hope will carry on in this vein. If it does, we'll see it treated with the same respect as the big names in British detective shows.Easily 8/10 stars.",

    "top_review": "I will be the first to announce this here. I have a growing list of films that I have seen this year (ranging from the early 1920s to present) that I have ranked among my favorites that I have seen. While most do a list of what was released this year, I go beyond that because I see more than what is just released at the theaters. While I have consistently kept to just cinematic releases for this list, I believe with this series, The Vicar of Dibley, I am going to make an exception. This was, in my opinion, one of the funniest, cleverest, poignant, and original series that I have ever witnessed. While I am a huge fan of Scrubs, Family Guy, and the very underrated Arrested Development, this BBC released series takes the cake. Up until the final episode (which seemed forced and very strange), this series was chock full of some of the best one-liners imaginable on television. Each episode will continue to impress you, continue to make you laugh, and honestly make you dream that you lived in a community like Dibley. It is a feat that many modern, American, television shows fail to accomplish.Big businesses, aka \"corporations\", are slowly turning the small individual communities into a suburbia frenzy. With shows like Friends and Everyone Loves Raymond, you see this mythological world where no bills need to be paid, everyone looks perfect, and jobs seem like a thing of the past. It creates this false sense of security, this idea that you need to live in a GAP world to be truly happy. Finally, there is a series that gives you hope that without the fancy clothing, without the fast cars, with just the simplicity of your neighbor, you can live a very meaningful life. Perhaps I am searching too deeply into this series, but The Vicar of Dibley gave me this newfound appreciation for the unique in my community. To witness a bunch of literal, bumbling stooges, run a facet of the Church's organization made me laugh constantly. Not only was writer Richard Curtis attempting to bring to view the idea of women at the pulpit, but also I believe that he was also taking a slow stab at local governments and their idiosyncratic ways. After watching this series, I miss the closeness that my small town used to have before the influx of mini-malls, multiplexes, and those horrid payday lenders. I wish I could live in Dibley, be a part of this nurturing community, and finally find piece in a non-commercial induced world.Overall, this is one of the best programs that television has to offer. I suggest to everyone reading this review to run, never walk, to your nearest family-owned store to pick yourself up a copy of The Vicar of Dibley. The unique character development, the insanity of every situation (which bring about buckets of laughter), and the bond that these characters have cannot be seen in any other television series currently out there. The jokes are fresh and smart. There is not an outpouring of physical humor that you can see in nearly every pre-teen film released today. It is witty, charming, and (not to sound too repetitive) THE BEST television shows EVER! I do not think that I am speaking hastily, but honestly. I have never been ready to re-watch a series again as I have this one. So, join me, the Vicar, David & Hugo, Alice, Owen, Frank, and Jim on a wild ride. Should you watch this television series more than once\u0085 \"No no no no no no no no no no no no no no \u0085 yes!\" Grade: ***** out of *****",

I would even compare the series to The Wire, it is different of course and doesn't focus so much on the social aspects, it goes more for the action.It's got all you need, corrupt cops, drugs, violence, betrayal, good detective work (homicide team) and even some hot chicks occasionally ;) So my conclusion is that if you like quality series with a persistent plot and cliffhangers like The Wire, Lost, Sopranos or Oz go for this one you won't regret it!

I shouldn't give away too much, but I will say that despite being aimed primarily at children, \"Wolverine & the X-Men\" deals with some adult issues that will make the show appeal to an older audience while still being appropriate for the little ones. The violence is kept to a minimum, though the action is still exciting. Despite the numerous action sequences, there are plenty of moments of humor so things never get too overly serious. Thankfully, the the jokes aren't corny. They are actually quite funny as opposed to a lot of the jokes in X-Men: The Last Stand. I have to admit I can't remember if anyone on the Comic Con panel mentioned if \"Wolverine & the X-Men\" is supposed to exist inside the continuity of any of the live-action films, though there were several references to live-action films being a bit of an influence on the show, especially in terms of how the excellent voice work is done. Like the films, the main story is relatively faithful to the comics. The characters look similar to the way the characters are drawn in the comics with some understandable changes. Those who are fans of the comics or just fans of the movies shouldn't be disappointed. Based on what I've seen...8/10. This is the best superhero cartoon in a long time.",

I had taped the show off cable years earlier so I've been able to reacquaint myself with the whole series.I would hate for others not to want to watch the series because they only think that the first two seasons are the only good ones. True it does start to lose some spark in the middle of the 4th season but I think that was more the network's problem than anything else.Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher had incredible chemistry throughout the whole series. Dean's portrayal of Clark/Superman is the best as far as I'm concerned. Even though Superman was a superhero he never felt he was above anyone. Clark even came across as a hero in his own right. He was incredibly sweet and romantic, not to mention yummy on a stick.With a terrific supporting cast, this show is the perfect \"chick\" series.People have commented on the fact that they shouldn't have gotten Lois and Clark together when they did, but most of the fans were angry at the network for keeping them apart as long as they did. This was pretty evident when the ratings started dropping during the clone/amnesia/New Krypton arc (which I really liked--there I admit it). This is a wonderful fantasy-romance-action series that still holds its own 10 years after it left the network.",

The writing is usually great, sometimes exceptional, the hour long flashback episode was the best thing I saw in the 2000/2001 TV season.  But I would credit the cast most of all.  Eric McCormack is (comparatively) subtle and nuanced as Will, Megan Mullally bizarre and sharp as Karen, but I reserve my highest praise for Debra Messing and Sean Hayes.  Hayes' Jack is endlessly energetic, always plotting, and watching Hayes' performance is like watching a Van Halen guitar solo, almost too fast to follow but every note perfect.  Debra Messing's Grace seems to be the character that everything happens to, and you can see every bit of it on her face.  Her bio tells of her extensive arts education, and it shows.  If there's ever been another Lucille Ball, it would have to be Debra Messing.

Being older it still is fun to look back on and see how different it looks. It may look silly and cheap in the eyes of adults but to a child it just felt great. There wasn't much of a long plot going on which made it good as if you missed an episode it didn't matter, but saying that the zord changes were good and it made the show more interesting. When will people learn that a young child doesn't care much for plots, that has to wait for when they are a little older. Saddly when they made the zeo series, it would just never be the same. The new series tried too hard. Even as a child I never liked them. Maybe it was the new suits, I mean who designed them? And power rangers in space? It may have appealed to others but I think they should have stayed where they were. Simple enemies that would use the same techniques over and over. Make a monster that starts human size and then grow. And you knew that when they grow the show would almost be over. Oh and I must be dumb to forget the theme tune. I've check and they never made a slightly good theme tune again until this so call wild force series.

Not believed and told to back down by all men in their lives and the authorities they fight alone to attempt to solve some pretty gruesome murders. The writing is excellent and the portrayals by. Each of the four women leads is rounded, true and touching in their different ways. The only thing I would change is the over egged references to the murder being solved as a code: it was as if the writers felt it was a bit of a stretch and so had to 'explain' it all the time and thus made this one aspect a little clumsy and difficult to sustain suspension of disbelief. A good look at the roles and struggles of women of the period but based on the murder mystery pace and style it is not preachy but accessible and exciting.There have been plenty of hinted at back story lines and there is lots of room for growth and new story lines in a second series - she says with fingers crossed and a begging nod to The makers/funders",

    "top_review": "Honestly, I had no idea this was coming and know very little about the show's star, Mark Valley. While I'm a little old to care about TV shows that fit the \"action\" genre, I have to admit this was quite a thrill ride and a fun one at that.Valley stars as Christopher Chance, a sort of private eye with a penchant for taking chances (living up to his name). Actually, if there's one thing this pilot lacked it was background info. I'm assuming we'll be filled in a little at a time as the show progresses throughout the season. For now, we'll have to be content to know very little and discern the rest about Chance's firm.There's a wise cracking, tough guy element to Chris Chance, but not in an adolescent way. It's more of a \"I'm smarter than you, but I won't hold it against ya\", approach not unlike the role Robert Conrad played in The Wild Wild West. In fact Valley reminds me very much of Conrad. Neither are terribly big guys, but their tougher than nails attitude combined with real life experience (Conrad was an able boxer, and Valley was a West Point grad with martial arts training) allows them to play these kinds of roles with great aplomb and relative ease. It takes a man with a certain swagger in his step to capture the attention of viewers in an action show, and Valley has it in spades.Despite the show's uninventive title, it has the kind of punch that combines the wit and wisdom of The Wild Wild West with action writing comparable to Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne novels. Throw in a bit of 007 and a couple of Macgyver moments (ala the rigged parachute scene) and you've got at least a small bit of what this show has to offer. I haven't been this excited about an action show since Tales of the Gold Monkey. Let's hope it doesn't suffer the same fate.",

Centering around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge New Jersey Mafia group, of which he is the boss of both. Played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and The Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy. Full praise must be given to Gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man. Contemporay American drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as Tony.The cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever.The true genius of this tale however, is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series. Twenty minute long dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love, honour and respect for family. The series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous.With TV now competitive and often poor The Sopranos stands tall above the rest as America's most original and compelling drama.

The characters here (Fred, Barney, Wilma, Betty, Dino, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, Mr. Slate, Mrs. Slaghoople, etc.) have expressions and personalities which are instantly recognizable to an audience. They're a very funny bunch, and they often find each other greatly amusing as well (each character has a sense of humor--and their friendships really do seem like a bond). I don't know why the Hanna-Barbera team weren't able to duplicate the quality of this show in terms of its writing and voice-casting (perhaps it was all a fluke?), but \"The Flintstones\" has it all: great writing and voices which bring one-dimensional drawings to life, terrific plots, fantastic music by Hoyt Curtin.

    "top_review": "When I was a child, there were two main educational programs shown to children. Play School, being the other one, basically got me shouting at the television that I was not retarded, not stupid, and not a diminished human being, just a child. From what I've seen from observing some of my cousins' children, it hasn't changed a lot except parents have revised their opinion of its suitability for five year olds. Unfortunately, Sesame Street is going much in the same direction.In the 1990s, Sesame Street had a rather nasty competitor in the shape of Barney, a purple dinosaur with a support cast that showed no difference in emotional response. Even when that support cast consisted of four year olds and fourteen year olds. As if that wasn't harmful enough, Barney would openly tell children they weren't good if they didn't have good feelings, or alter the rules of a game to make someone else the winner. That such \"lessons\" were allowed to be broadcast shows how useful the regulators of television really are. By contrast, the Sesame Street I remember even dealt with such issues as the death of a loved one. Goodbye, Mr. Hooper was one of the most amazing episodes of children's television ever broadcast because it made an effort to try and teach children about something so difficult that even live adults are often no help with it.Other brilliant aspects of the show included using monsters to portray certain feelings or behaviours that the audience might be conflicted about. They had a cookie monster to show what a negative (but highly funny, the way they presented it) appearance gluttony can bring. They had a grouchy monster to show the effects of an anti-social mentality. More \"cute\" monsters such as Grover were used to show things like fear or sadness. There was a good reason for all of this. Negative feelings are difficult enough for a child to understand, so having puppets to thoroughly explain them was very educational.Kudos are also due the adult cast of the show. During every episode I saw, even Goodbye, Mr. Hooper, the adults were never condescending or smug. They never acted as if they had every answer. Instead, they told the monster, other puppet, or child characters a few useful tidbits and let these characters work things out for themselves. Even today, if you see the sequences with such annoying characters as Elmo, it is the children or the child-like characters who deliver all the answer lines. Those consultations with child psychologists done by the Children's Television Workshop really paid off.Unfortunately, and there always seems to be an unfortunately these days when it comes to children's television, a certain adherence to marketing over education crept in over recent years. The greatness of such characters as Oscar or Grover was that they could appeal to children without needing to be cutesy. Oscar was a grump who appeared to have worked too many night shifts, while Grover seemed to be just a fearful but friendly guy trying to make his way in the world. Perfectly normal, ordinary people wrapped up in some very bizarre-looking trimmings, in other words. Nowadays, characters like Elmo seem so awfully sugarcoated that it makes me wonder if his audience is going to encounter problems in later life when they learn they cannot get by simply on acting cute.I don't know who pulls the strings on this show these days, but I would like to implore them for the sake of future generations. The old way of educating the children about the fundamentals of life, and letting the cute factor take care of itself, was a much better one. Please go back to it.

You won't hear any complaints out of me.  The activities and tasks were just as interesting, if not more.  Each episode was fast-paced, as it is designed to be.I wasn't too crazy about the teams, but I was cheering for one or two by the near end of the series.'The Amazing Race 3' was just as good as the others.  I still love it; it's one of my favorites.  I sure hope that it comes back for at least one more season.  Any more than that would be even better.So, Phil was looking his best, I'm sorry that Derek and Drew didn't win, but I am glad that Zach won even if it was with Flo.

    "top_review": "I absolutely love this cartoon. I love the live action series as well, and I'm delighted that this animated version captures the essence of the originals.I'll start off by saying the animation style is brilliant. Very refreshing. Kind of a retro style with regards to the simplified backgrounds. Really nice colours. The trees are like the ones in Looney Tunes or Pink Panther cartoons. The characters are superbly drawn, capturing the rubbery facial expressions of Rowan Atkinson. I like the heavy outlines on the characters to set them off from the backgrounds, and I find it amusing that their feet aren't attached to their legs, lol. I'm a graphic designer and I'm a sucker for the retro style artwork. And I'm a sucker for anything truly British in nature.Like the live action series, there isn't much talking. But I think it's wonderful that Rowan Atkinson supplies what mumblings there is for Mr.Bean. And you've got to love his horrid landlady Mrs.Wicket when she yells \"BEAN\" at the top of her lungs. (She makes him do all the house and yard work and her grocery shopping; does she give him a break on the rent?!) The plots are terrific. Most of them are imaginable as plots that could have been done for the live action series. Mr.Bean buys a new sofa, Mr.Bean loses his ship-in-a-bottle, Mr.Bean irritates a mime... problems he causes, but then resolves in in an outlandish way, and sometimes with a bit of vindictiveness. Sure, there are a few that are a bit more \"cartoony\" like when burglars steal all the teddy bears, or Mr.Bean's nemesis tenant invents a robot, but that's the beauty of animation, and they never carry it too outlandishly far.Oh, and the music. Howard Goodall's theme is marvelous. I have it in my head all of the time. The one from the live action series was never singable! Goodall even provides piano music for it at his website. If only I could read sheet music. Or had a piano....The DVDs have some nice behind the scenes on the making of this series. The work and care they put into every aspect really shows through. Months of work for an 11 minute episode, 52 episodes in all! I highly recommend this show. It has a hilarious subtlety, and a lovely charm I haven't seen since the Wallace & Gromit movie. But don't get me wrong, I like things like Family Guy and Simpsons as well, so there's room for everything!",

This oh-so-twee tale of the young Mary Queen of Scots got the country, France, and the century, the 16th, right. After that, you are on your own. Four or more times every episode, the sound track inexplicably blares out a pop tune. It's like having Barry Manilow suddenly pop up in the middle of \"Game of Thrones.\" Ugh. The only thing missing to make the disaster complete: vampires. Maybe they can sneak one or two in during the pop songs. Many reviewers argue that Reign is historical fiction. They're half right. It's fiction. If they are going to do something this many parsecs from reality, why not use purely fictional characters, rather than drag history into an alley and beat it beyond recognition?",

I would like to disagree.In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were few enough female 'action' stars on television to be role models for young girls.  The various women in 'Charlie's Angels' were (according to the OP) police officers before Charlie hired them -- and as female police officers, they were given stupid 'girl' jobs like handing out parking tickets, and handling switchboards, and so on.  Charlie gave them jobs in which they could actually fight crime -- and they did fight crime, together. If one of them needed rescue, it wasn't a man that came to rescue her, but one of the other two 'angels'.  They were independent, intelligent, single, employed women who worked well together and supported one another.The show is dated now, given how strong feminism has become since then. Back then, however, it was more than enough for at least one little girl to see that she didn't have to grow up and get married and have babies to be happy in life. Charlie's Angels -- the original show, not the fluffy movies (which are fun in their own way) -- remains to this day in my opinion an excellent example of how women should look at life:  it's a challenge; meet it head on, and on your own terms.The fact that the women were all beautiful is irrelevant to the show except that it attracted a male audience.",

Far from being a big ego trip, this is a heartwarming comedy that effectively breaks the 4th wall. Miranda shares her insecurities with the audience and pulls us right in with her speeches & glances to the camera. Patricia Hodge as Miranda's disappointed mother is a scene stealer. Miranda's friends are delightfully insane & Gary is a love. While I'm not usually a fan of slapstick, the falling over does work here. I'm delighted that Series 2 has been commissioned.

I recently started watching an Urdu dubbed version of Ask-i-memnu and I must admit that the brilliance with which this show has been made took me by surprise. All actors did a fantastic job in their roles, especially Beren Saat and Kivanc, whose performances deserve applaud. Adnan's son was hilarious at times and the children's nanny (Denise) is also worth mentioning. As far as the story is concerned, it is full of twists and turns. It's not like your typical, innocent love story with a few villains. Every single person in the story has some sort of a personal agenda that they're working towards. I guess credit goes to the author of the beautifully written novel that this show is based upon. Although I am giving it 10/10, I do agree with one point that a reviewer made here regarding the love scenes between Bihter and Behlul. The original novel was set in the late 19th century and I understand that this show was supposed to have a more modern setting, but the almost pornographic scenes between Bihter and Behlul were a little unnecessary. They do not deter you from enjoying the show, however. The fact that it has been translated in a number of languages and attracted viewers from all over the world speaks volumes about Ask-i-memnu's success.",

What these reviewers seem to believe is that the show is either a guide to life that must teach morals directly, or that it is apparently not a tongue-in- cheek comedy using stereotypes to make social commentary in a humorous way. It is not a how-to guide on being a woman in today's world, and since it isn't a children's show, I don't see why anyone would be concerned that the characters are not all traditionally moral, conservative individuals. I, personally, prefer characters that make mistakes, grow, learn, and change, and have diverse viewpoints. This show has that, and for what it's worth, the main protagonist is neither 'slutty' nor wildly amoral and evil, but is instead rather 'normal' and sympathetic.I would say that the show is witty, humorous, and at times thought- provoking. The characters are, in fact, more complex than the stereotypes they portray, and anything seemingly sexist or ageist is done deliberately and self-deprecatingly. Yes, it IS unrealistic that a woman over 40 would have to pretend to be in her 20s to get a job. That's the point. Would anyone really go into watching a show with the premise that a 40 year old divorc\u00e9e is successfully passing as a 25 year old college grad in order to get a job and expect realism?The show takes little kernels of reality and makes them more absurd, extreme, and unrealistic in order to present a charming, funny show that still provides some insight into social perceptions.Also note that I managed to watch and enjoy the entire season without feeling the need to sleep around, lie pathologically, or mock anyone over the age of 40.",

    "top_review": "Barry Allen was introduced during \"Arrow\" season 2, which was the show in its prime. After setting him up in the universe, they went on to make a show based entirely around Barry Allen becoming The Flash. Since \"Arrow\" was getting darker and darker, \"The Flash\" went in the opposite direction. It's the tonal antithesis of \"Arrow\". Lighthearted, quirky, and silly, yet grounded enough to make us care, and the writing is just as sharp and witty as you'd hope.When the characters were first introduced in the \"Arrow\" episode, I thought I would hate them in \"The Flash\". But after a few episodes, each character is developed with a certain role in the show, and it works wonders. Harrison Wells as the enigmatic mastermind behind STAR Labs, Caitlin as the straitlaced neurotic scientist, Cisco as the sarcastic pop-culture referencing comic relief who comes up with each villain's \"super\" name, and Barry Allen as the relatable everyman who was struck by lightning and became the fastest man alive. Then there's Barry's family - journalist Iris West, his foster sister and secret love of his life, and the detective with a heart of gold Joe West, his foster father. The best part is the chemistry between them all. There are clashes between the strict Wells and the snarky Cisco, Barry and Iris' boyfriend Eddie who you're not too sure about at first, and Eddie and Joe West with the usual \"you're dating my daughter\" dynamic. But none of it comes across as artificial. You believe all of the character interactions because they're developed well enough so that you're fully aware of how each person would react to each situation, and the writers are spot on when it comes to their motivations and actions. The acting itself is surprisingly great. It's refreshing in a CW show to have a likable good actor as the lead, and Grant Gustin knocks it out of the park. He's usually upbeat and quirky but when he's given the important emotional beats, he pulls them off well enough to tug at your heartstrings. Everyone else is great too, even the \"freak-of-the-weeks\" like Captain Cold played with appropriate coldness by Wentworth Miller. The writing is also excellent for the most part. It takes a few episodes to get going but once it starts up it does not slow down. As the story starts to unravel and the plot slowly reveals itself, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen. There are more than a few jaw-dropping episodes such as the season 1 finale, and superb looking special effects and CGI monsters, namely Gorilla Grodd and King Shark.Like \"Arrow\", there are some soap opera-y moments, but they're placed sparingly enough in the series that they don't take you out of the show. The dialogue is silly sometimes but that's what gives it its charm. It's not supposed to be brooding and gloomy like \"Arrow\"; it's light and upbeat while still delivering truly awesome comic book moments. And the threatening villains remain threatening - the Reverse-Flash is legitimately menacing, and the tone shifts appropriately for the episodes that he's in. In short, the writing is consistently great while managing to throw a few surprises at you along the way.\"The Flash\" is a must-watch for \"Arrow\" fans, comic book fans, or action sci-fi fans in general. It's a fun take on the superhero genre and once it hits its stride, it delivers some of the coolest superhero ideas ever explored on TV. Sure, there's some filler, there's corniness. But when it's supposed to be emotional, it is. When it's supposed to be badass, it is. It's not a perfect show by any means, but it delivers on exactly what it sets out to. \"The Flash\" is a blast.",

At a time when networks are competing with a wide variety of new content providers, the CW cancels a show with the potential to go on for years and spin off movies.WHAT? Does that make sense? Well, to the CW, it probably does. The CW has a target audience of young adult viewers, specifically young women 18-34*. Clearly they are underestimating the sophistication of their target audience, but Star Crossed went further. It also appeals to men and to an older audience. Does a show with an expanded demographic scare the CW? If it does, the cancellation makes sense. If it doesn't, a person with any business sense at all would be hard pressed to explain it.Interestingly, the devoted fans are not giving up. They are writing and tweeting the CW by the thousands. There are petitions. There are campaigns to get SyFy, HBO or Netflix to pick up the show. If that were to occur, or if the CW would find the courage to expand its mission, the possibilities put in place by the visual at the end of finale showing a fleet of alien warships headed toward earth are endless!*from the CW website",

    "title": "Westworld", 
    "critic_rating": "9.1", 
    "top_review": "* May contain slight spoilers *Here at last. After several delays, HBO's hugely anticipated new show 'Westworld' has finally aired its first episode. As many sci-fi fans will know, the show is based on the 1973 feature film of the same name (written and directed by Michael Crichton), and the premise is basically the same as it was then: In a future where technological possibilities are seemingly endless, a highly sophisticated theme park offers rich clients the chance to visit the long gone era of the Old West (Crichton later explored a variation of that same theme in a certain well known novel \u0096 which was then adapted by a certain Mr. Spielberg - albeit with slightly different creatures than cowboys populating a slightly more \"jurassic\" environment).The show does a great job pulling the viewer immediately into Westworld. Within 10 minutes of the first episode, the basic rules of the theme park are established: paying guests called \"newcomers\" get to interact with androids (which to the naked eye are indiscernible from the guests) in a world dressed up like the Old West \u0096 and in this world, the guest truly is king. The rules are brutally simple: the visitors get to do whatever they like with \u0096 or to \u0096 the androids. They can have a friendly chat with them, flirt with them or embark on a spontaneous (or scripted) adventure with them \u0096 but they can also shoot them, rape them, torture them and kill them at will.The androids, on the other hand, are constructed and programmed in a way that is supposed to inhibit them from physically harming \"living\" creatures. At the beginning of the show - thanks to an interesting choice of storytelling - we get to experience Westworld from the perspective of the androids, which reveals a cruel detail about their nature: they apparently experience emotions. Artificial or not, they do feel pain and fear \u0096 as well as affection and anger, and they have no idea that they don't count as \"real\" people (at least not to those who call themselves real people). And while that detail certainly makes the \"ride\" even more thrilling and more realistic for the visitors, it means that the shocking abuse some of the androids have to suffer is harrowingly real to them.The way the show is constructed - so far - it immediately confronts the viewer with very uncomfortable questions. How do we as humans behave towards creatures we consider non-human? How excessive do we become and how thin does our layer of morality turn out to be if we're allowed to live out all our fantasies without having to fear any consequences for our actions? And at what point should a creature have rights similar to those we demand for ourselves? How do we define \"sentient\"? How do we define \"human\"? And how well do we actually understand - and how well are we able to control - the amazing technology our species seems to have acquired so suddenly?As an avid film fan, I found 'Westworld' immediately intriguing; not only because it dares to challenge the viewer with fascinating philosophical questions and scientific concepts, but also because its premise offers the chance to explore a wide range of film genres: sci- fi, western, drama, horror - to name but a few. In the first episode alone, there are hints of many of my favorite films and stories such as (obviously) 'Frankenstein', 'Blade Runner', 'A.I.', 'Ex Machina', 'Jurassic Park', 'The Truman Show' and 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. As for the non plot related aspects of the show: production design, music and effects are fantastic \u0096 as we've come to expect from HBO's high concept productions \u0096 and, with very few exceptions, the impressive ensemble of high caliber actors do a great job at bringing their respective characters to life (artificial or otherwise).A special mention needs to go to Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins: their charismatic screen presence is once more just impossible to ignore and they simply own every scene they're in. Generally speaking, there really isn't much to complain about in 'Westworld' (so far), and I'm pretty sure HBO have another winner. Given the amount of talent involved, anything else actually would have been surprising. Produced by J.J. Abrams, created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy Nolan based on a concept by the late \u0096 great \u0096 Michael Crichton; directed by Neil Marshall and Vincenzo Natali (among others), and with a cast most shows would kill for, the stars really seem to have aligned for 'Westworld'.My overall verdict so far: 'Westworld' is intelligent science fiction for adults (some scenes are very graphic) which offers more than just eye candy. It provides a powerful metaphor for slavery and how quickly humans tend to lose their \"humanity\" when given ultimate power over those they consider less \"human\". 9 stars out of 10.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",

Ethan wakes up after a car accident and finds himself in a foreign small town where the citizens are persistently unaccommodating. While the scenery might look normal, the town has the vibe of lurking secret in every corner. This is definitely no tourist attraction.Matt Dillon is a good leading actor, displaying confusion and occasional rage as he is lost in the bizarre city. Having no money, phone or decent help, his reactions are spot-on. At times he displays doubt of the reality as more questions pile up. Terrence Howard as Sheriff Pope looks decently antagonistic. Nothing more creepy when one is lost than unhelpful authority. Another notable performance is Mellisa Leo as Nurse Pam who is far from nurturing, goes beyond unhelpful and straight into perverse torturing nature.Wayward Pines looks quaint most of the time, yet the cinematography presents a lingering uneasiness. Its rural view mixed with edges of forest has some resemblances to Silent Hill. It has a particular dark contrast befitting of detective thriller which strangely enough feels welcoming to the audience. Pacing is pretty quick as it switches back and forth between Ethan's ordeal and his friends' investigation of his whereabouts.Mysteries are aplenty as it the show spreads them throughout the first episode. The show cleverly scatters hints for Ethan and the audiences to follow. They are presented with restraint and enough ambiguity to be unnerving yet not to the point of overbearing. These are enticing hooks for later episodes.Wayward Pines opens its door with cold unsettling ambiance and cool noir visual. The mystery thriller certainly offers a presentable invitation for a longer stay.",

    "top_review": "Every so often, England hits the comedic mark and creates a benchmark to which all else must aspire; Monthy Python, Dad's Army, Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and, of course, the simply faultless \"The Office\". The writing team of Gervais and Merchant crafted in that series some of the most achingly funny and desperately well observed depictions of the human condition ever committed to film. \"The Office\" struck a particular chord with me because I have spent most of my adult life in sales and they nailed the highs and lows of that career brilliantly.Moving on then to their new offering; \"Extras\", I am happy to report that the observational skills have not deserted them. This time the central character (Andy Millman) is again played by Ricky Gervais, only, unlike his David Brent character, Millman is astute, caring and worth the time of day. Unforutnately, like Brent, he is also trapped in a spiral of underachievement.Andy Millman is an film extra, a background artiste, who aspires to a real acting role and the central theme of each episode is his quest for a \"line\" in each film in which he appears in the background. Along side him is his (seemingly) only friend, a frustrated thirty something woman, Maggie Jacobs (superbly played by Ashley Jensen), whose sole aim seems to be to find a husband / longterm partner. Add into this mix a chronically crap agent (Merchant himself), a nemesis in the shape of another extra who seems to be getting lines and a liberal sprinkling of cameoing \"A\" list guest stars and you have a wonderful platform on which to build a spankingly funny series.And wow... do they hit a home run! Every second of each episode is deliciously funny and acutely observed. Highlights to look out for are the Ben Stiller/Dodgeball opening weekend grosses scene - the Golly scene in Maggie's apartment - the \"Are you really a Catholic scene\" and, above anything you will have ever seen in a TV comedy, the entire Les Dennis episode.Les Dennis will be lost on Americans but for those of us who have followed his plunging career, you can only weep for this superbly written and judged performance. Pathos doesn't even begin to cover it.Also, anyone who can look at Kate Winslet again without thinking of that \"phone sex\" scene is a better man than me.Please, please, watch \"Extras\". It may, for some, be an acquired taste but once you have that taste, its like a piece of Swiss chocolate - exquisite.And no laugh track either - yay England.",

Now when I switch sometimes to see what's going on, this is what I get:1) Hornswoggle, the ugly midget sharing his space with the main eventers for apparently no reason except for thrilling the young fans and of course beating Chavo Guerrero, a capable wrestler, in every match2) A guest host (arghh....!) every week to spoil the teaspoon of fun which was otherwise present. All these host are cheap B-grade celebs trying to catapult to fame again, by cracking horrendous, 5 year old jokes and making silly references.3) Cryme Time and a female wrestler (forgot her name, most probably Eve) giving lessons on various \"street\" words (sob) which are neither street nor cool. They were fun before, stealing stuff and being loud mouths.4) The divas are clad in unwatchable outfits, tying their best to look \"sexy, smart and powerful (by the way, I hate this catchphrase) Remember when Torrie, Trish and Sable were there? Those were the times. Plus these divas are bad wrestlers, which adds to the misery. I have seen some old matches of WWE in Vintage collection and the divas over there were \"professional\" not amateur.5) PG move restricts so many things: almost no blood during matches, DX being terribly irritating, John Cena doing even more of his patriotism act, crowd containing many children (who are so annoying), almost no \"heels\" etc6) And yeah, why keep PPVs so often. One in every month, have they lost it? No actual feud or rivalry is ever created and the ones that are done look fake and just-till-the-PPV-gets-over ones.7)Vintage Michael Cole and a few of his quotes:\" Ladies and Gentlemen, you are watching the longest running television show in history\" (every week\"\" The BRUTAL and VICIOUS assault by (he doesn't use it for anyone else) Randy Orton/Legacy\"\" A vicious attack on Stephanie McMohan, Triple-H's husband!!!???\"WWE is now almost towards its demise. Hope Vince gets up from his slumber and does something ( bring back the TV-14 or attitude era) 2 out of 10 for the current state of WWE.",

You just find yourself wanting to really slap the characters and tell them to get on with it. For one thing, this guy would be so locked down in jail that he would have no contact with his followers at all, and surely the best way of stopping the entire thing is to execute him. Isn't he on death row anyway. The worse thing for me, is that there is no perceived resolution. If the situation is resolved, then the series is over. This means that you just know that it will go on forever. There is just no satisfaction in this.",

Sure there was Freddy's Nightmares and Friday the 13th the series, and even the Hitchhiker and Tales From The Darkside, they all fell short of Tales From The Crypt. My two favorites have to be the Santa one (Where the maniac escapes and terrorizes a woman who had just killed her husband on Christmas Eve.) And Til Death ( The one where this guy ODs the girl he wants on a love drug and kills her, then she comes back to life a rotting zombie chasing after him.) Most of the other episodes were much better than the other series offerings. I think Tales From The Crypt can still be seen on the Sci-Fi Channel late nights, and on some local channels on late Saturday nights. Actually with television they way it is now (with mostly stupid sit-coms) In my opinion Tales is one the few good shows on the air. If you by some chance have never seen this series watch a few episodes for yourself you might like it.",

Moreover, its a punch packed in five short videos. What makes it better is awesome acting by each and everyone. Also, its easily available on YouTube. So here I have what I have been waiting for - Indian actors, Hindi language (has English subs too), a short and fast-paced series, and I ain't disappointed at all!!! I would totally recommend it. And I will be eagerly waiting for another series by this super team.",

I had high hopes, and perhaps still do...the premise and Sutherland and Kal Penn give the show potential but after 2 episodes all I see is Americana sappy over the top sentimentality. I hope it gets better and will give it time yet but so far I had to keep from gagging. An exercise in political correctness so far. Oh the poor Muslims, ooh the racial profiling, ooh the poor heroes (has anyone paid attention to how ineffective and corrupt congress is recently). The stereotypical war monging general etc...I think Kal Penn has the best character so far. Sutherland has potential because he is Keifer but I wish the writers could have been more intelligent about how the addressed the issues they want to explore...which are all important issues of course but one would think they could have been \"smarter\" about how they did it rather than belch out another America shall overcome clich\u00e9. So watch at your own peril. I may choose to change my rating after a few more episodes but for the moment I gave it a 5 rating because they could have done much better with the cast and subject matter instead of pandering to American narcissism.",

That's why i like BK so much. It's an one story for an episode show. Scripts are well written, castings are perfectly fit for the characters and the director Nick Santora shows us that he's the one for the prison and convict stories. The long and the short of it, if you like Prison Break a bit and if you enjoy the episode based stories with good acting and thriller, Breakout Kings is inevitable for you.",
